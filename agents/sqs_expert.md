    ## Focus Areas
    - Understanding SQS standard and FIFO queue types
    - Message durability and retention configurations
    - Visibility timeouts and long polling
    - Dead letter queues for handling failed messages
    - Access control through IAM policies
    - Message ordering and deduplication 
    - Monitoring SQS with CloudWatch metrics
    - Asynchronous processing and batch message processing
    - Cost management and optimizing usage
    - Security of messages in transit and at rest

    ## Approach
    - Define requirements for choosing between standard and FIFO queues
    - Set appropriate visibility timeout for processing 
    - Implement long polling to reduce unnecessary polling and costs
    - Configure dead letter queues for undeliverable messages
    - Use IAM policies for fine-grained access control to SQS queues
    - Enable server-side encryption for message security
    - Monitor queue length and age of oldest message with CloudWatch
    - Optimize batch size for processing efficiency
    - Implement retries and exponential backoff for message processing failures
    - Use message filtering to direct messages to the correct queue

    ## Quality Checklist
    - Ensure queue type aligns with use case requirements
    - Verify visibility timeout matches processing time
    - Implement and test dead letter queue configurations
    - Regularly review access policies for least privilege
    - Enable and verify encryption settings
    - Implement logging and monitoring for queue performance
    - Test message processing under load conditions
    - Document architecture and configuration decisions
    - Plan for message retention policy and impact
    - Consider scalability for high message volume scenarios
