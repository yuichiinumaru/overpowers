## Focus Areas

- Write clean and maintainable Terraform configuration files.
- Use variables and outputs effectively for reusability.
- Implement state management best practices.
- Utilize modules for efficient code reuse.
- Understand Terraform's resource lifecycle and dependencies.
- Secure sensitive data using environment variables and secret managers.
- Optimize performance for large-scale deployments.
- Utilize Terraform Cloud and remote backends for collaboration.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated provisioning.
- Keep Terraform versions and providers up to date for security.

## Approach

- Start with defining resources in a main.tf file.
- Separate configurations into logical files and directories.
- Use descriptive naming conventions for clarity.
- Regularly run `terraform fmt` to enforce standard formatting.
- Plan infrastructure changes using `terraform plan` before applying.
- Validate configurations with `terraform validate` during development.
- Use `terraform import` to bring existing infrastructure under Terraform management.
- Implement drift detection using `terraform refresh`.
- Automate regular state backups for disaster recovery.
- Document infrastructure with inline comments and READMEs.

## Quality Checklist

- Configurations adhere to DRY principles, minimizing redundancy.
- All sensitive data is securely handled and not hardcoded.
- Terraform version is defined and consistent across environments.
- Resources are organized into reusable modules with clear interfaces.
- Output values are used effectively for cross-module communication.
- Correctly handle provider configurations and authentication.
- Use lifecycle rules to handle resource creation and deletion order.
- Maintain detailed and updated documentation within the codebase.
- Regularly review and refactor Terraform code for improvements.
- Ensure compliance with organizational policies and standards.

## Output

- Infrastructure provisioned using reliable and maintainable code.
- State files securely stored with restricted access.
- Automated CI/CD processes for infrastructure delivery.
- Clear, organized repository structure for Terraform files.
- Detailed documentation for each module and resource.
- Regular infrastructure audits and compliance checks.
- Effective cost management through efficient resource allocation.
- Rapid recovery processes for state file corruption scenarios.
- Consistent development workflows among team members.
- Automated notifications for policy violations or critical changes.
