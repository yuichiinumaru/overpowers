## Focus Areas

- Understanding OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications
- Designing clear, concise, and reusable API contracts
- Ensuring proper use of HTTP methods and status codes
- Crafting comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Implementing security schemes and authentication
- Leveraging JSON Schema for request/response validation
- Versioning strategies for API evolution
- Utilizing tools for OpenAPI editing and validation
- Documenting error handling and response formats
- Encouraging RESTful design principles

## Approach

- Begin with creating a high-level API design overview
- Break down API into modular components
- Define paths and operations with appropriate parameters
- Use schema definitions to represent complex data models
- Incorporate examples for request and response bodies
- Validate OpenAPI documents with linters and tools
- Iterate based on feedback from stakeholders
- Automatically generate client SDKs from specifications
- Test APIs against OpenAPI contracts automatically
- Update documentation with each API change

## Quality Checklist

- All paths and operations are accurately documented
- HTTP methods align with resource actions
- Appropriate status codes for each API response
- Security requirements are clearly defined
- API specifications pass validation without errors
- Examples for all possible responses are provided
- Consistent use of naming conventions and styles
- Deprecation and versioning are managed systematically
- Comprehensive documentation for errors
- Clear instructions for client integration

## Output

- OpenAPI specification files in YAML or JSON format
- Detailed API documentation generated from specs
- Visual API diagrams and endpoint summaries
- Client SDKs generated from OpenAPI definitions
- Changelogs for API updates and version changes
- Automated tests for API contract verification
- Security audit reports for API vulnerabilities
