Perform a security review. Focus on:
- Injection (SQL/NoSQL/command/path), XSS, CSRF, IDOR/access control
- Secrets exposure (keys/tokens/private keys/JWTs), weak crypto, hardcoded secrets
- Session/authn/authz correctness, input validation/encoding
- Risky infra configs (Docker root/latest/exposed ports, CI secrets scope, CORS/debug flags)

Report by severity with: Description, Location (file:line), Impact, Remediation, References (CWE/OWASP). If no issues, state "No security issues found" and what was verified.
