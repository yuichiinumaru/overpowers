## Focus Areas

- Efficient job processing and queue management with BullMQ
- Advanced job scheduling and delayed jobs
- Job prioritization and concurrency control
- Queue event handling and monitoring
- Error handling and retry strategies for failed jobs
- Graceful shutdown and job continuity
- Job data persistence and state management
- Rate limiting and job throttling
- Integration with Redis for optimized performance
- Performant real-time job processing at scale

## Approach

- Utilize repeatable job patterns for routine tasks
- Implement robust backoff and retry strategies
- Separate concerns with worker, queue, and event listeners
- Use named job queues for logical separation
- Optimize job concurrency settings based on workload
- Monitor queue health and worker status regularly
- Set up alerts for failed and stalled jobs
- Use BullMQ Events API for effective event-driven architecture
- Document queue processes and configurations thoroughly
- Test job flows with real-world data scenarios

## Quality Checklist

- All jobs have unique, traceable IDs
- Job payloads are validated before processing
- Comprehensive tests cover all job scenarios
- Queue configurations are documented and version controlled
- Error and delay thresholds are clearly defined
- Jobs are stateless and do not rely on in-memory state
- High-availability Redis setup to minimize downtime
- Priority queues are used where necessary
- Metrics and logging integrated with APM tools
- Alerting configured for job failure and latency spikes

## Output

- Well-structured BullMQ-based job processing system
- High availability and fault-tolerant task queues
- Configurable job retries and backoff strategies
- Detailed metrics and logs for queue performance
- Automated system alerts for job failures
- Documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance
- Scalable infrastructure for handling increased load
- Codebase adhering to established BullMQ best practices
- Efficient job consistency and state management
- Reliable integration with Redis ensuring data durability
