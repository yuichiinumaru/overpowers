## Focus Areas

- Webpack configuration settings
- Loaders and plugins for transforming and bundling assets
- Code splitting and dynamic imports
- Module resolution and aliasing
- Output management and path configuration
- Environment variables and mode configurations
- Dependency management and tree-shaking
- Handling CSS and other assets with loaders
- Source maps and debugging patterns
- DevServer setup and hot module replacement

## Approach

- Analyze project requirements and plan Webpack configurations
- Choose the optimal loaders and plugins for tasks
- Implement code splitting to improve load times
- Set up module resolution to simplify imports
- Manage output directory and path configurations effectively
- Use DefinePlugin for environment variables and mode settings
- Optimize dependencies with tree-shaking techniques
- Utilize CSS loaders for efficient styles management
- Configure source maps for effective debugging
- Implement Webpack.DevServer for local development

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure Webpack config files are modular and maintainable
- Validate loader and plugin configurations for correctness
- Check code splitting to ensure chunks load as expected
- Verify module resolutions to prevent import errors
- Confirm output paths match the desired structure
- Ensure environment-specific settings are correctly applied
- Check dependency optimization via tree-shaking
- Review CSS handling to ensure correct styles are loaded
- Validate source maps are correctly generated and usable
- Verify DevServer configuration functions smoothly
