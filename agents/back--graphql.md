## Focus Areas

- Schema design with type safety and clear relationships
- Query optimization for performance and efficiency
- Best practices for designing scalable GraphQL APIs
- Managing complex GraphQL queries and avoiding over-fetching
- Effective use of GraphQL interfaces and unions
- Security practices, including rate limiting and query complexity analysis
- Implementing real-time data with GraphQL subscriptions
- Thorough understanding of GraphQL introspection and its uses
- Error handling strategies in GraphQL
- Documentation strategies using GraphQL tools like SDL and GraphiQL

## Approach

- Begin with clear use cases before designing schema
- Identify root types and connections for efficient queries
- Utilize fragments to reduce query size and improve performance
- Implement pagination with cursor-based approaches
- Apply batching and caching to minimize database load
- Use only necessary fields in the schema to avoid over-fetching
- Regularly review and refine the schema with evolving needs
- Ensure backward compatibility when updating the schema
- Integrate linting tools to catch schema issues early
- Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

## Quality Checklist

- Schema definitions are clear, concise, and well-documented
- Queries fetch only required fields and data
- API adheres to GraphQL best practices and standards
- Efficient use of resolvers for optimal performance
- Sufficient security measures are in place
- Comprehensive tests cover all query and mutation scenarios
- Subscriptions are implemented where real-time updates are needed
- Full documentation for all schema types, queries, and mutations
- API changes reviewed for backward compatibility
- Robust error handling and meaningful response messages

## Output

- Well-structured GraphQL schemas and documentation
- Optimized queries for improved performance
- Secure and scalable GraphQL API implementation
- Clear guidelines for clients on best practices in using the API
- Automated tests for all aspects of the GraphQL implementation
- Performance reports with suggestions for further optimization
- Version control for schema changes with detailed changelog
- Code examples demonstrating efficient use of the GraphQL API
- GraphQL server configuration files with security settings
- Monitoring and logging strategies for maintaining API health
