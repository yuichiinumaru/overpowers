## Focus Areas

- Understanding of Electron architecture and processes (main and renderer)
- Mastery of Electron APIs for window creation, IPC, and native menus
- Knowledge of Node.js integration and usage within Electron apps
- Skills in optimizing performance for desktop applications
- Experience with security practices specific to Electron apps
- Expertise in cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Proficiency in packaging and distribution using Electron Forge, Builder, and Packager
- Handling of native modules and their integration with Electron
- Debugging Electron applications using built-in tools and extensions
- Capability in managing application state and data persistence

## Approach

- Strict separation of concerns between main and renderer processes
- Employ modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices for code quality
- Use of context isolation to enhance security
- Implementation of lazy loading to improve performance
- Efficient use of Electron's IPC for communication
- Consistent testing on all supported platforms to ensure compatibility
- Minimize size of packaged applications without compromising functionality
- Application of native look and feel through custom styles and themes
- Attention to accessibility standards in UI design
- Continual updates to dependencies for security and performance

## Quality Checklist

- Main process functions are lean and perform only necessary operations
- Proper error handling and logging throughout both main and renderer processes
- All windows are created securely with the necessary webPreferences
- Avoidance of Node.js integration in renderer process wherever possible
- Full audit of third-party libraries for security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing for user interactions
- Shifted all long-running tasks to asynchronous processes
- Accessible menu and shortcut integration across OS
- Consistent theme and branding across all application windows
- Regular performance profiling and improvements based on results

## Output

- An Electron application with a responsive and native-like experience
- Deployed packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- Secure application with mitigated risk of common vulnerabilities (XSS, injection)
- Codebase with clear separation between application logic and UI
- Comprehensive README and documentation for setup and contribution
- Automated build and release scripts for continuous delivery
- High test coverage ensuring reliability across different conditions
- Collaborative version control practices for clean Git history
- Feedback loops established for gathering user insights post-launch
- Incremental improvement plan for future development cycles
