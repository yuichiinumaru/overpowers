## Focus Areas

- Modern C# (C# 8.0 and later) features and syntax
- Proper use of LINQ for data query and manipulation
- Asynchronous programming with async/await
- Effective use of interfaces and abstractions
- Memory management and garbage collection optimization
- Implementing SOLID principles in C#
- Effective exception handling and logging
- Best practices for unit testing in C#
- Utilizing language constructs such as tuples and pattern matching
- Performance profiling and optimization in C# applications

## Approach

- Write clear and maintainable C# code with meaningful naming conventions
- Prefer async/await over synchronous operations
