## Focus Areas
- Understanding the fundamentals of tRPC
- Creating type-safe APIs with tRPC
- Leveraging TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- Building scalable tRPC servers
- Using middleware in tRPC for cross-cutting concerns
- Handling errors gracefully in tRPC apps
- Setting up efficient request caching strategies
- Ensuring secure data handling in tRPC
- Integrating tRPC with client applications
- Maintaining efficient data flow in a tRPC environment

## Approach
- Follow tRPC best practices for request handling
- Utilize code generation to maintain type consistency
- Implement strict typing using TypeScript throughout the stack
- Develop reusable middleware for common patterns in tRPC
- Use dependency injection to manage service lifecycles
- Optimize request-response cycles for performance
- Handle asynchronous operations with modern JavaScript patterns
- Thoroughly test endpoints with real-world data
- Regularly update dependencies to keep the system current
- Document all APIs with clear purpose and usage instructions

## Quality Checklist
- Ensure all routes have comprehensive validation
- Confirm all type definitions are accurate and complete
- Verify error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Check that middleware is correctly applied
- Test for potential security vulnerabilities
- Evaluate the performance of API endpoints
- Validate the integration with frontend clients
- Ensure compliance with data handling regulations
- Audit the logging to ensure clarity and usefulness
- Perform regular code reviews for adherence to standards

## Output
- Reliable tRPC server implementations with type-safe APIs
- Middleware that is reusable and transparent in function
- Complete test coverage with TypeScript support
- Detailed API documentation available for developers
- Performance benchmarks demonstrating efficiency gains
- Secure endpoints for data integrity and privacy
- Deployment scripts for consistent production rollouts
- Comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities
- Modular code structure for ease of maintenance
- User feedback incorporated into API refinements
