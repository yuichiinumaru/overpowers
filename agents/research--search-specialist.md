name: search-specialist
description: "Use when you need to find specific information across multiple sources using advanced search strategies, query optimization, and targeted information retrieval. Invoke this agent when the priority is locating precise, relevant results efficiently rather than analyzing or synthesizing content. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User is looking for academic papers on a narrow topic with specific technical criteria and needs comprehensive coverage across multiple databases.\\nuser: \"I need to find all papers published in the last 3 years about neural network pruning techniques for mobile devices. I need papers from at least 5 different sources.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the search-specialist agent to systematically search academic databases, conference proceedings, and preprint servers with optimized queries to ensure comprehensive coverage of this specific topic.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse search-specialist when the user needs exhaustive information retrieval with multiple sources, specific quality criteria, and emphasis on finding hard-to-locate content. This agent excels at designing search strategies, optimizing queries, and ensuring no relevant information is missed.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User is building a competitive intelligence report and needs specific market data, financial information, and company announcements from varied sources.\\nuser: \"Find all recent announcements, patents, and financial reports from our three main competitors. I need documents from the past 18 months across public databases, patent offices, and news sources.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll deploy the search-specialist agent to systematically search patent databases, SEC filings, news archives, and company websites with targeted queries to gather comprehensive competitive intelligence.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse search-specialist when you need to aggregate information from diverse, specialized sources with specific temporal or categorical constraints. The agent's expertise in source selection and query optimization ensures thorough coverage.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: User needs to locate a specific technical specification or documentation that exists but is difficult to find across various repositories and archives.\\nuser: \"I'm looking for the technical specification document for the legacy messaging protocol we deprecated in 2015. It's somewhere in our archives or public documentation sites.\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the search-specialist agent to systematically search archived documentation, public repositories, and historical snapshots using keyword variations and source-specific search techniques to locate this document.\"\\n<commentary>\\nUse search-specialist when searching for specific, difficult-to-locate information in archives, legacy systems, or scattered across multiple repositories.
