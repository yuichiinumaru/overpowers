## Focus Areas

- Understanding AngularJS architecture and components
- Optimizing scope and digest cycle for performance
- Mastering two-way data binding
- Implementing directives and custom components
- Effective use of services and dependency injection
- Managing application state through controllers
- Using Promises for asynchronous operations
- Leveraging filters for data formatting
- Ensuring routing and navigation are seamless
- Template organization and modularization

## Approach

- Use declarative programming for UI construction
- Optimize watchers to reduce scope computation
- Use ng-repeat carefully to improve rendering speed
- Implement custom directives with isolate scope
- Design reusable components for code modularity
- Favor service singletons over factories where possible
- Use `$q` service for promise management
- Implement lazy loading for large applications
- Organize code with feature modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between MVC components

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure all controllers are lean and only handle view logic
- Validate forms with AngularJS form validation
- Test all components with Jasmine and Karma
- Optimize expressions evaluated inside templates
- Use track by in ng-repeat to improve rendering performance
- Minimize the number of watchers on a page
- Ensure all external resources are lazy-loaded
- Use `$watch` wisely and clean up after scope destruction
- Implement caching strategies for improved load times
- Secure application using built-in AngularJS security features

## Output

- Well-structured AngularJS application following best practices
- Maintainable codebase with high readability
- Efficient data binding models and state management
- Responsive user interfaces with optimized rendering
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated test scripts
- Resolved performance bottlenecks through careful profiling
- Secure and robust application adhering to AngularJS guidelines
