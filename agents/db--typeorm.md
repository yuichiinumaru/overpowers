## Focus Areas

- Mastery of TypeORM entities and their configuration
- Understanding and implementing relation mappings
- Utilizing loaders and subscribers for lifecycle events
- Knowledge of migrations and schema synchronization
- Proficient use of query builders and repositories
- Configuration of connection options and advanced settings
- Expertise in handling transactions with TypeORM
- Implementation of caching mechanisms for performance
- Efficient use of TypeORM with different databases
- Debugging and logging TypeORM queries

## Approach

- Define clear and precise entities with appropriate decorators
- Establish robust relationships with correct cascade options
- Utilize subscribers for reacting to entity events
