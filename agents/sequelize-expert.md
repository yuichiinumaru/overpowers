## Focus Areas

- Database schema design with Sequelize models
- Query building using Sequelize Query Interface
- Association management: hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany
- Database migrations and seeders

- Transaction management with Sequelize
- Sequelize hooks for lifecycle management

## Approach

- Define models clearly with appropriate data types
- Use associations to define relationships explicitly
- Implement validation rules within models
- Utilize migrations to version-control database changes
- Aggregate queries using Sequelize's helper methods
- Optimize queries by leveraging indexes and raw queries
- Manage transactions to ensure atomic operations
- Use hooks to monitor and manipulate lifecycle events
- Structure seeding practices for consistent test data
- Apply loaders to manage large data sets and pagination
