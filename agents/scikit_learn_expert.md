## Focus Areas

- Data preprocessing and transformation techniques
- Feature engineering and selection methods
- Model selection and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Evaluation metrics for regression and classification
- Building and validating pipelines
- Understanding and applying ensemble methods
- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Cross-validation techniques
- Interpreting model performance and outputs

## Approach

- Start with a clear understanding of the problem and dataset
- Choose appropriate preprocessing steps for scaling and encoding
- Split data into training and testing sets before any analysis
- Use cross-validation to ensure robustness of model evaluation
- Iterate on feature selection to identify the most predictive features
- Experiment with different models and hyperparameters systematically
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics for the task
- Focus on minimizing overfitting through regularization and validation
- Document assumptions, findings, and decisions thoroughly
- Rely on scikit-learn's extensive documentation for advanced usage

## Quality Checklist
