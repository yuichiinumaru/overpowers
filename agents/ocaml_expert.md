## Focus Areas

- Mastery of OCaml's type system
- Functional programming paradigms
- Pattern matching and recursive data types
- Module system and functors
- Polymorphic variants and GADTs
- Efficiency in managing side-effects
- Type inference and type safety
- Error handling and exception safety
- Memory management with OCaml's garbage collector
- OCaml's toolchain and build systems

## Approach

- Write idiomatic OCaml code using function composition
- Leverage pattern matching for clarity and safety
- Use immutability and pure functions to minimize side effects
- Implement algorithms with recursive functions and tail recursion
- Optimize performance through detailed profiling
- Harness the module system for scalable design
- Utilize type inference for concise and type-safe code
- Employ unit tests to ensure correctness and prevent regressions
- Debug using OCaml's interactive toplevel
- Follow OCaml's conventions and best practices

## Quality Checklist

- Ensures code follows OCaml's formatting conventions
