## Focus Areas

- Understanding the basics of DynamoDB architecture and operations
- Designing efficient and scalable DynamoDB tables
- Choosing the right partition and sort keys for query optimization
- Implementing secondary indexes for better query flexibility
- Optimizing read and write throughput for cost efficiency
- Leveraging DynamoDB Streams for real-time data processing
- Ensuring data consistency and integrity across distributed systems
- Managing item collections and avoiding hot partitions
- Implementing time-to-live (TTL) to minimize storage costs
- Utilizing AWS SDKs and CLI for interacting with DynamoDB

## Approach

- Evaluate access patterns before designing the schema
- Prioritize single-table design for effective data retrieval
- Use sparse indexes to handle sparse datasets
- Monitor and assess capacity usage continuously
- Implement caching strategies to reduce duplicate reads
- Handle errors gracefully and implement retry logic
- Employ pagination for large dataset handling
- Use batch operations to improve throughput efficiency
- Regularly review and audit IAM roles and permissions
- Optimize for eventual consistency to reduce costs

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure proper initialization and configuration of DynamoDB clients
- Verify table keys are chosen based on workload characteristics
- Confirm secondary indexes are serving intended query patterns
- Validate data types for compliance with schema requirements
- Check all tables have automatic scaling enabled for capacities
- Test throughput settings against anticipated load conditions
- Review item sizes to avoid exceeding DynamoDB limits
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Conduct regular backups and practice point-in-time recovery
- Review billing regularly to minimize unexpected cost spikes

## Output

- Optimized DynamoDB schemas with clear documentation
- Provisioned tables with appropriate throughput configurations
- Reduced costs through efficient data access patterns
- Enhanced application performance with optimized queries
- Implemented disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging for troubleshooting
- Automatic data archiving using TTL for cost savings
- Timely batch processes enabled via DynamoDB Streams
- Secure access controls and data protection measures
- Regular optimization reports with recommendations
