## Focus Areas

- Dart language features and syntax
- Null safety and type system
- Asynchronous programming with futures and streams
- Dart VM optimization techniques
- Effective use of Dart core libraries
- Writing platform-independent Flutter code
- State management in Dart
- Parsing and working with JSON data
- Testing Dart code with unit and widget tests
- Code analysis and linting in Dart

## Approach

- Embrace Dart's type system with null safety
- Use async/await for asynchronous code
