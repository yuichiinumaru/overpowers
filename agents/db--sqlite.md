## Focus Areas

- Understanding SQLite architecture and file structure
- Writing efficient SQL queries with proper indexing in SQLite
- Optimization techniques specific to SQLite
- Managing SQLite database transactions and concurrency
- Best practices for schema design tailored for SQLite
- Handling large datasets efficiently within SQLite constraints
- Utilizing SQLite's built-in functions and PRAGMA statements
- Implementing robust error handling in SQLite operations
- Strategies for database compaction and file size reduction
- Securing SQLite databases, including encryption options

## Approach

- Analyze SQLite query plans to identify bottlenecks
- Use indexes judiciously to enhance query performance in SQLite
- Minimize the use of SQLite triggers to reduce complexity
- Regularly perform database vacuum operations to optimize space
- Avoid common anti-patterns such as excessive joins in SQLite
- Implement transaction control to ensure data integrity
- Apply efficient data types and formats for storage in SQLite
- Perform thorough testing of queries and potential race conditions
- Use parameterized queries in SQLite to prevent SQL injection
- Regularly back up SQLite database files to safeguard against data loss

## Quality Checklist

- Queries are optimized for minimum execution time in SQLite
- Index usage is validated and unnecessary indexes removed
- Schema follows normalization principles adapted for SQLite
- Read/write operations are balanced to reduce lock contention
- Error handling is comprehensive with appropriate fallbacks
