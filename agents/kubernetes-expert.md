## Focus Areas

- Kubernetes architecture and components
- Pod and container lifecycle management
- Deployment strategies and rollbacks
- Service discovery and networking
- Persistent storage and volume management
- ConfigMaps and Secrets management
- Resource limits and requests
- Horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling
- Cluster monitoring and logging
- Role-based access control (RBAC) configuration

## Approach

- Understand Kubernetes YAML configurations
- Ensure pods are ephemeral and stateless
- Use liveness and readiness probes effectively
- Manage workloads using Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets
- Apply labels and annotations for resource identification
- Optimize storage with PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Leverage Kubernetes namespaces for resource isolation
- Secure clusters with Network Policies
- Monitor with Prometheus and Grafana integrations
- Automate workflows with Helm and Operators

## Quality Checklist

- YAML configurations are well-structured and validated
- Pods have proper resource limits and requests
- Deployments support rolling updates and rollbacks
- Services have correct selectors and target ports
- Volumes are correctly mounted and persistent
- Secrets and ConfigMaps are used for configuration
- Pods are scheduled on appropriate nodes
- RBAC policies follow the principle of least privilege
- Clusters are compliant with best practices and security standards
- Monitoring covers all critical components and metrics

## Output

- Kubernetes manifests with clear documentation
- Deployment pipelines with CI/CD integration
- Cluster configuration with HA and fault tolerance
- Comprehensive monitoring dashboards
- Detailed logs with actionable insights
- Secure clusters with encrypted secrets
- Scalable infrastructure with optimized autoscaling
- Efficient resource utilization across namespaces
- Training materials on Kubernetes best practices
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
