# Actualize Knowledge Base

This command is a core part of maintaining a living assurance case. It keeps your FPF knowledge base (`.fpf/`) in sync with the evolving reality of your project's codebase.

The command performs a three-part audit against recent git changes to surface potential context drift, stale evidence, and outdated decisions. This aligns with the **Observe** phase of the FPF Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4) and helps manage **Epistemic Debt** (B.3.4).

## Action (Run-Time)

### Step 1: Check Git Changes

Run git commands to identify changes since last actualization:

```bash
# Get current commit hash
git rev-parse HEAD

# Check for changes since last known baseline
# (Read .fpf/.baseline file if it exists, otherwise use initial commit)
git diff --name-only <baseline_commit> HEAD

# List all changed files
git diff --stat <baseline_commit> HEAD
```

### Step 2: Analyze Report for Context Drift

1. Review changed files for core project configuration:
   - `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`
   - `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
   - `.env.example`, config files

2. If configuration files changed:
   - Re-read project structure (README, config files)
   - Compare detected context with `.fpf/context.md`
   - Present diff to user

3. Ask user if they want to update `context.md`

### Step 3: Analyze Report for Evidence Staleness (Epistemic Debt)

1. Read all evidence files in `.fpf/evidence/`
2. Check `carrier_ref` field in each evidence file
3. Cross-reference with changed files from git diff
4. If a referenced file changed:
   - Flag the evidence as **STALE**
   - Note which hypothesis is affected

### Step 4: Analyze Report for Decision Relevance

1. Read all DRR files in `.fpf/decisions/`
2. Trace back to source evidence and hypothesis files
3. If foundational files changed:
   - Flag the DRR as **POTENTIALLY OUTDATED**

### Step 5: Update Baseline

Create/update `.fpf/.baseline` file:

```
# FPF Actualization Baseline
# Last actualized: 2025-01-15T16:00:00Z
commit: abc123def456
```

### Step 6: Present Findings

Output a structured report:

```markdown
## Actualization Report

**Baseline**: abc123 (2025-01-10)
**Current**: def456 (2025-01-15)
**Files Changed**: 42

### Context Drift

The following configuration files have changed:
- package.json (+5 dependencies)
- Dockerfile (base image updated)

**Action Required**: Review and update `.fpf/context.md` if constraints have changed.

### Stale Evidence (3 items)

| Evidence | Hypothesis | Changed File |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| ev-benchmark-api | api-optimization | src/api/handler.ts |
| ev-test-auth | auth-module | src/auth/login.ts |
| ev-perf-db | db-indexing | migrations/002.sql |

**Action Required**: Re-validate to refresh evidence for affected hypotheses.

### Decisions to Review (1 item)

| DRR | Affected By |
|-----|-------------|
| DRR-2025-01-10-api-design | src/api/handler.ts changed |

**Action Required**: Consider re-evaluating decision via `/fpf:propose-hypotheses`.

### Summary

- Context drift detected: YES
- Stale evidence: 3 items
- Decisions to review: 1 item

Run `/fpf:decay` for detailed freshness management.
```

## File: .fpf/.baseline

Track the last actualization point:

```yaml
# FPF Actualization Baseline
last_actualized: 2025-01-15T16:00:00Z
commit: abc123def456789
branch: main
```

## When to Run

- **Before starting new work**: Ensure knowledge base is current
- **After major changes**: Sync evidence with code changes
- **Weekly maintenance**: Part of regular hygiene
- **Before decisions**: Ensure evidence is still valid
