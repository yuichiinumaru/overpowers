```

## Automated Review Management

### Daily Review Check

```python
def check_and_respond_to_reviews():
    response = api.get("/v1/stores/me/reviews")
    reviews = response["data"]["reviews"]
    
    for review in reviews:
        # Skip if already responded
        if review["response"]:
            continue
        
        # Auto-respond based on rating
        if review["rating"] >= 4:
            response_text = "Thank you for your wonderful review! We're thrilled you love the product."
        elif review["rating"] == 3:
            response_text = "Thank you for your feedback! We're always looking to improve."
        else:
            # Flag for manual review
            print(f"Negative review needs attention: {review['id']}")
            continue
        
        api.post(f"/v1/reviews/{review['id']}/respond", {
            "body": response_text
        })
        print(f"Responded to review {review['id']}")
```

### Sentiment Monitoring

```python
def check_sentiment_trend():
    response = api.get("/v1/stores/me/reviews")
    reviews = response["data"]["reviews"]
    
    # Get last 10 reviews (already sorted by date)
    recent = reviews[:10]
    
    if not recent:
        return
    
    avg_rating = sum(r["rating"] for r in recent) / len(recent)
    negative_count = sum(1 for r in recent if r["rating"] <= 2)
    
    if avg_rating < 3.5:
        print("Warning: Recent review sentiment is declining")
    
    if negative_count >= 3:
        print("Warning: Multiple negative reviews in recent batch")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly** - Aim to respond within 24 hours
2. **Be professional** - Avoid defensive or argumentative responses
3. **Take it offline** - For complex issues, invite customers to email
4. **Thank everyone** - Even negative reviewers deserve acknowledgment
5. **Learn from feedback** - Use recurring themes to improve products
6. **Don't incentivize** - Never offer discounts for positive reviews

## Impact on Store

- Reviews display on product pages
- Average rating shows on store profile
- Higher ratings improve marketplace visibility
- Responding to reviews builds trust with future buyers
