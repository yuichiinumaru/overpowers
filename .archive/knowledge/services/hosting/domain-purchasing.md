## 🚀 **Domain Purchasing Usage**

### **Domain Availability Checking:**

```bash
# Check single domain availability
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh check-availability personal example.com

# Bulk check multiple domains
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh bulk-check personal example.com example.net example.org

# Check with pricing information
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh check-availability personal premium-domain.com
```

### **Domain Purchasing:**

```bash
# Purchase domain (with confirmation prompt)
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh purchase personal mynewdomain.com 1 true

# Purchase domain for multiple years
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh purchase personal longterm-project.com 3 true

# Purchase without auto-renewal
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh purchase personal temporary-project.com 1 false
```

### **Domain Portfolio Management:**

```bash
# List all registered domains
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh domains personal

# Get domain details including expiration
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh domain-details personal mydomain.com

# Monitor domains expiring soon
./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh monitor-expiration personal 30
```

## 🛡️ **Purchasing Security & Best Practices**

### **Purchase Confirmation:**

```bash
# Example purchase flow with confirmation:
$ ./.agent/skills/infrastructure/scripts/spaceship-helper.sh purchase personal newproject.com 1 true

[INFO] Checking availability before purchase...
[SUCCESS] Domain newproject.com is available for registration
Price: $12.99
[WARNING] Domain newproject.com will be purchased for $12.99 for 1 year(s)
[WARNING] This action will charge your account. Continue? (y/N)
y
[INFO] Purchasing domain: newproject.com
[SUCCESS] Domain purchased successfully
```

### **Security Measures:**

- **Confirmation prompts**: All purchases require explicit confirmation
- **Spending limits**: Configure maximum purchase amounts
- **Account verification**: Verify account balance before purchases
- **Audit trails**: All purchases are logged and auditable
- **Access control**: Restrict purchasing to authorized users

### **Financial Controls:**

```bash
# Set spending limits in configuration
{
  "purchasing_settings": {
    "confirmation_required": true,
    "max_purchase_amount": 500,
    "daily_purchase_limit": 10,
    "require_approval_over": 100
  }
}
```
