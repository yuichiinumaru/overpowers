## Jan 2026: The "Oh My OpenCode" Migration & Expansion

### 1. Integration of "Oh My OpenCode" (Jan 19)
*   Massive ingestion of components from `oh-my-opencode`.

### 3. Protocol & Naming fixes (Jan 19-23)
*   Addressed "Gemini 400 Bad Request" errors.
*   Sanitized agent names to `snake_case` to comply with stricter model protocols.

### 4. Jules Swarm (Jan 16)
*   Integrated `jules-swarm` submodule for parallel task orchestration.
*   Workflows: Dispatch -> Harvest -> Triage -> Integrate.

### 5. Personas Integration (Jan 19)
*   Generated 13 role-based personas (e.g., `devops-engineer`, `security-auditor`).
*   Integrated "YAAMCPL" (Yet Another Awesome MCP List) winners into these personas.
