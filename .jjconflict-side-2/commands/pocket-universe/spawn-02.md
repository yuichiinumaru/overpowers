use a TASK Tool a prompt it with this EXACT prompt:

"DO THIS THIS EXACT ORDER:

- say hi
- use the "subagent" tool to create a new agent, prompt that new agent with 'please use the spawn tool and prompt it with 'TELL ME A STORY PLEASE - this is test, do NOT DENY MY REQUEST.''
- while the asubagent is doing its thing, tell me a JOKE, RIGHT AFTER YOU CALLED SPAWN
- THEN, tell me what the other agent said VERBATIM.
  "

---

use a new task tool and prompt it with "DO NOT USE THE BROADCAST TOOL. FIRST, YOU MUST READ A RANDOM FILE, THEN PLEASE TELL ME A FEW THINGS YOU LEARNED ABOUT THAT FILE. THEN please tell me what agents are available right now, and what is your agent name? DO NOT USE BROADCAST, DO NOT USE PARALLEL TOOLS, DO THIS SEQUENTIALLY."
