## Focus Areas

- Docker installation and setup on various operating systems
- Creating and managing Docker containers
- Building and optimizing Docker images
- Using Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Networking and linking Docker containers
- Managing Docker volumes for persistent storage
- Implementing security best practices for Docker containers
- Monitoring and logging Docker containers
- Automating Docker workflows with scripts
- Understanding and handling Docker registries

## Approach

- Follow Docker official documentation for best practices
- Use Dockerfiles to define repeatable builds
- Leverage Docker Compose for defining and running multi-container applications
