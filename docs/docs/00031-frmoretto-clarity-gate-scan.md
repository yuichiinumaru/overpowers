| clarity-gate | 9-point epistemic verification system for document quality |

### The 9 Verification Points
**Epistemic Checks:**
1. Hypothesis vs. Fact Labeling
2. Uncertainty Marker Enforcement
3. Assumption Visibility
4. Authoritative-Looking Unvalidated Data

**Data Quality Checks:**
5. Data Consistency
6. Implicit Causation
7. Future State as Present

**Verification Routing:**
8. Temporal Coherence
9. Externally Verifiable Claims

### Two-Round HITL Verification
- Round A: Derived Data Confirmation (quick scan)
- Round B: True HITL Verification (real verification)

### Verification Hierarchy
- Tier 1A: Internal Consistency (automated)
- Tier 1B: External Verification (extension interface)
- Tier 2: Two-Round HITL
