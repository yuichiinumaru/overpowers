./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh renew-ssl mysite.local
```

### **Port Management:**

```bash
# List active ports
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh list-ports

# Check port availability
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh check-port 3000

# Kill process on port
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh kill-port 3000

# Forward port
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh forward-port 3000 8080
```

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### **Local Development Security:**

- **Isolated environments**: Keep development environments isolated
- **SSL certificates**: Use valid SSL certificates for HTTPS testing
- **Access control**: Limit access to development services
- **Data protection**: Protect sensitive development data
- **Network isolation**: Use isolated networks for development

### **SSL Certificate Management:**

```bash
# Generate development CA
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh generate-ca

# Create site certificate
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh create-cert mysite.local

# Trust certificate in system
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh trust-cert mysite.local

# Verify certificate
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh verify-cert mysite.local
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Domain Resolution Issues:**

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup mysite.local
dig mysite.local

# Verify hosts file
cat /etc/hosts | grep mysite.local

# Test local connectivity
ping mysite.local
```

#### **SSL Certificate Issues:**

```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text -noout

# Verify certificate chain
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh verify-chain mysite.local

# Regenerate certificate
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh regenerate-ssl mysite.local
```

#### **Port Conflicts:**

```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :3000
netstat -tulpn | grep :3000

# Kill conflicting process
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh kill-port 3000

# Use alternative port
./.agent/skills/localhost-integration/scripts/localhost-helper.sh start-on-port mysite.local 3001
```
