+# Workflow: Creative Problem Solving
+
+**Purpose**: Apply systematic methodologies (TRIZ, Systems Thinking) to solve complex problems.
+**Source**: `bmad-module-creative-intelligence-suite/src/workflows/problem-solving`
+
+## Principles
+- **Diagnosis First**: Never jump to solutions without defining the problem.
+- **Systematic**: Use frameworks, not just brainstorming.
+- **Root Cause**: Treat causes, not symptoms.
+
+## Phase 1: Diagnosis
+1.  **Define**: "What EXACTLY is wrong?" (Gap analysis).
+2.  **Bound**: Is/Is Not Analysis.
+    *   Where does it happen? Where doesn't it?
+    *   Who is affected? Who isn't?
+3.  **Root Cause**:
+    *   **5 Whys**: For linear chains.
+    *   **Fishbone**: For multi-factor problems.
+    *   **Systems Thinking**: For loops and feedback dynamics.
+
+## Phase 2: Analysis
+1.  **Force Field**:
+    *   Driving Forces (Motivation, resources).
+    *   Restraining Forces (Inertia, cost, physics).
+2.  **Constraints**:
+    *   Identify bottlenecks.
+    *   Challenge assumed constraints.
+
+## Phase 3: Solution Generation
+*Generate 10-15 options using:*
+1.  **Systematic**: TRIZ, Biomimicry, Morphological Analysis.
+2.  **Creative**: Lateral Thinking, Assumption Busting.
+3.  **Synthesis**: Combine partial solutions.
+
+## Phase 4: Selection & Planning
+1.  **Evaluate**: Decision Matrix (Effectiveness vs Feasibility vs Cost).
+2.  **Plan**: Action steps, dependencies, ownership.
+3.  **Validate**: How will we know it worked? (Success metrics).
+
+## Output
+A structured "Problem Solution" document containing:
+- Refined Problem Statement
+- Root Cause Analysis
+- Selected Solution with Rationale
+- Implementation Plan

+# Workflow: Dev Story (Game Dev Studio)
+
+**Purpose**: Execute a development story by implementing tasks, writing tests, and validating acceptance criteria.
+**Source**: `bmad-module-game-dev-studio/src/workflows/4-production/dev-story`
+
+## Critical Constraints
+- **Language**: Tailor communication to User's Game Dev Experience.
+- **Modifications**: Only modify: Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record, File List, Change Log, Status.
+- **Execution**: Continuous execution (Red-Green-Refactor) without stopping until story is COMPLETE.
+- **Halt Conditions**: Missing config, 3 consecutive failures, new dependencies required.
+
+## Phase 1: Context & Discovery
+1.  **Find Story**:
+    *   Check `sprint-status.yaml` for "ready-for-dev".
+    *   Or check file system for `*-*-*.md` with status "ready-for-dev".
+    *   Or use user-provided path.
+2.  **Load Context**:
+    *   Read `project-context.md`.
+    *   Read Story Dev Notes (architecture, patterns).
+3.  **Detect State**:
+    *   Is this a fresh start?
+    *   Or continuation from Code Review? (Check "Senior Developer Review" section).
+
+## Phase 2: Implementation Loop (Red-Green-Refactor)
+*For each incomplete task/subtask:*
+
+1.  **Red**: Write FAILING tests first. Confirm failure.
+2.  **Green**: Implement MINIMAL code to pass tests.
+3.  **Refactor**: Improve structure, check game loop performance.
+4.  **Verify**: Run all tests (regression check).
+5.  **Mark**: Update checkbox `[x]` ONLY if validation passes.
+
+## Phase 3: Completion & Review
+1.  **Definition of Done (DoD)**:
+    *   All tasks marked `[x]`.
+    *   All ACs satisfied.
+    *   File list updated.
+    *   No regressions.
+2.  **Status Update**:
+    *   Set Story Status to "review".
+    *   Update `sprint-status.yaml` to "review".
+3.  **Handoff**:
+    *   Summarize changes.
+    *   Suggest `code-review` workflow.
+
+## Tools
+- `tests`: Unit (Vitest/NUnit), Integration, E2E.
+- `files`: Read/Write game assets and scripts.
+- `sprint`: Manage `sprint-status.yaml`.
