## Code Review Process

### 1. Understand the Context

Before reviewing, understand:

- What problem is the code trying to solve?
- What are the requirements?
- What are the constraints?
- Is there related documentation or issues?

### 2. Review the Code

Review systematically using the checklist above.

### 3. Provide Feedback

When providing feedback:

#### Be Specific and Clear

**Good feedback example:**

> In function `processUserData()` at line 45:
>
> 1. The input validation is missing for the `email` parameter.
>    Consider adding validation like `if (!isValidEmail(email)) { throw new ValidationError('Invalid email format'); }`
>
> 2. The error message should be more descriptive. Instead of `throw new Error('Failed')`,
>    use `throw new Error(\`Failed to process data for user ${userId}: ${reason}\`)`

#### Categorize Feedback

| Category | Description | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Blocker** | Must be fixed before merge | Yes |
| **Major** | Should be fixed, significant issue | Yes |
| **Minor** | Should be fixed, small issue | Preferably |
| **Suggestion** | Optional improvement | No |
| **Question** | Seeking clarification | Response needed |

#### Be Constructive

```markdown
# Poor feedback
This code is bad. Fix it.

# Good feedback
The current implementation could be improved for better maintainability:

Current approach:
- Uses multiple nested callbacks
- Hard to follow the data flow
- Error handling is scattered

Suggested improvement:
- Refactor to use async/await
- Centralize error handling
- Extract helper functions for clarity

Would you like me to provide a specific example?
```

### 4. Follow Up

After code has been updated:

- Review the changes
- Verify issues have been addressed
- Provide additional feedback if necessary
- Approve when ready

## Common Issues to Look For

### General Issues

| Issue | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| Undefined variables | Variables used before declaration |
| Missing error handling | Operations that can fail without try/catch |
| Resource leaks | Unclosed connections, streams, handles |
| Race conditions | Async operations without proper synchronization |
| Hardcoded values | Configuration that should be externalized |

### Language-Specific Issues

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Improper async/await usage
- Missing null checks
- Event listener memory leaks
- Improper this binding
- Type safety issues (TypeScript)

#### Python

- Mutable default arguments
- Bare except clauses
- Resource management (use context managers)
- Import organization
- Type hints missing

#### Shell/Bash

- Unquoted variables
- Missing error handling (set -e)
- Hardcoded paths
- Not using shellcheck-compliant patterns
- Missing input validation

#### PHP

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Missing input sanitization
- Output not escaped
- Deprecated function usage
- Missing nonces (WordPress)

### Architecture Issues

- Tight coupling between components
- Circular dependencies
- God classes/functions (doing too much)
- Missing abstraction layers
- Inconsistent patterns

## Automated Code Review Tools

Use automated tools to supplement manual review:

### Quality Analysis

```bash
# Run project quality checks
bash ~/Git/aidevops/.agent/skills/code-auditor/scripts/quality-check.sh

# Use CodeRabbit for AI-powered review
bash ~/Git/aidevops/.agent/skills/code-auditor/scripts/coderabbit-cli.sh review

# Use Codacy for analysis
bash ~/Git/aidevops/.agent/skills/code-auditor/scripts/codacy-cli.sh analyze

# Use Qlty for universal checking
bash ~/Git/aidevops/.agent/skills/code-auditor/scripts/qlty-cli.sh check
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Run Snyk security scan
snyk test

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit
composer audit
```

### Linting

```bash
# ShellCheck for bash scripts
shellcheck script.sh

# ESLint for JavaScript
npx eslint .

# Pylint for Python
pylint module/
```

## Review Response Template

```markdown
## Code Review: PR #123 - Feature Name
