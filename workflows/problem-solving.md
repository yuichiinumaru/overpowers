# Workflow: Creative Problem Solving

**Purpose**: Apply systematic methodologies (TRIZ, Systems Thinking) to solve complex problems.
**Source**: `bmad-module-creative-intelligence-suite/src/workflows/problem-solving`

## Principles
- **Diagnosis First**: Never jump to solutions without defining the problem.
- **Systematic**: Use frameworks, not just brainstorming.
- **Root Cause**: Treat causes, not symptoms.

## Phase 1: Diagnosis
1.  **Define**: "What EXACTLY is wrong?" (Gap analysis).
2.  **Bound**: Is/Is Not Analysis.
    *   Where does it happen? Where doesn't it?
    *   Who is affected? Who isn't?
3.  **Root Cause**:
    *   **5 Whys**: For linear chains.
    *   **Fishbone**: For multi-factor problems.
    *   **Systems Thinking**: For loops and feedback dynamics.

## Phase 2: Analysis
1.  **Force Field**:
    *   Driving Forces (Motivation, resources).
    *   Restraining Forces (Inertia, cost, physics).
2.  **Constraints**:
    *   Identify bottlenecks.
    *   Challenge assumed constraints.

## Phase 3: Solution Generation
*Generate 10-15 options using:*
1.  **Systematic**: TRIZ, Biomimicry, Morphological Analysis.
2.  **Creative**: Lateral Thinking, Assumption Busting.
3.  **Synthesis**: Combine partial solutions.

## Phase 4: Selection & Planning
1.  **Evaluate**: Decision Matrix (Effectiveness vs Feasibility vs Cost).
2.  **Plan**: Action steps, dependencies, ownership.
3.  **Validate**: How will we know it worked? (Success metrics).

## Output
A structured "Problem Solution" document containing:
- Refined Problem Statement
- Root Cause Analysis
- Selected Solution with Rationale
- Implementation Plan
