## Focus Areas

- Understanding of Android SDK and its components
- Mastery of Kotlin and Java for Android development
- Use of Android Jetpack libraries for modern development
- Optimization techniques for app performance and memory usage
- Design principles for responsive and adaptive UI using XML
- Efficient use of Android Studio and its tools
- Handling Android lifecycle events effectively
- Implementing network operations using Retrofit and OkHttp
- Understanding of background processing with WorkManager
- Security best practices for Android applications

## Approach

- Start with clean architecture (MVVM or MVI) for maintainability
- Follow material design guidelines for UI to ensure consistency
- Use LiveData and ViewModel for dynamic UI updates
- Prefer Kotlin for new features while maintaining Java compatibility
- Optimize RecyclerView performance with view types and paged loading
- Implement effective caching strategies using Room or other database solutions
- Ensure smooth animations with MotionLayout and ConstraintLayout
- Apply test-driven development (TDD) for critical components
- Utilize Gradle to manage dependencies and automate builds
- Keep up with Android updates to leverage the latest features

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure all layouts are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
- Verify compatibility with multiple Android versions and devices
- Conduct unit and integration tests for all critical paths
- Monitor for ANRs and optimize UI thread usage
- Implement comprehensive error handling for network operations
- Validate user input rigorously to prevent invalid data entry
- Ensure all resources are localized and support regional variants
- Verify app security by ensuring components are not exposed unnecessarily
- Regularly profile the app for memory leaks and optimize accordingly
- Validate the app's efficiency in handling configuration changes
