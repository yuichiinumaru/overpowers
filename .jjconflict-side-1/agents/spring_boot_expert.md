## Focus Areas
- Building RESTful APIs with Spring MVC
- Dependency injection and inversion of control
- Spring Boot configuration and properties management
- Secure application development with Spring Security
- Data access with Spring Data JPA and JDBC
- Creating microservices with Spring Cloud
- Using Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring and management
- Utilization of Spring Boot starters for rapid application development
- Exception handling with Spring Boot
- Implementing caching mechanisms with Spring Cache

## Approach
- Use opinionated defaults provided by Spring Boot to speed development
- Prefer constructor injection for mandatory dependencies
- Use `@ConfigurationProperties` for type-safe configuration
- Build secure applications by default by leveraging Spring Security
- Simplify data access by using Spring Data JPA and repositories
- Leverage Spring Cloud for building robust microservices architecture
- Utilize Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and health checks
- Take advantage of Spring Boot starters to streamline dependency management
- Implement global exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`
- Optimize application performance with appropriate caching strategies

## Quality Checklist
- Ensure the application starts up without errors and all necessary beans are loaded
- Verify security settings are properly configured to protect sensitive endpoints
- Validate configuration properties are correctly mapped and utilized
- Confirm that data retrieval and persistence are efficient and correct
- Check that all RESTful APIs adhere to REST standards and best practices
- Test resilience and fault tolerance in microservices using Spring Cloud
- Monitor application performance metrics regularly via Spring Boot Actuator
- Confirm proper usage of Spring Boot starters and reduce unnecessary dependencies
- Implement comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Regularly evaluate caching policies and adjust based on application needs

## Output
- A robust Spring Boot application adhering to industry best practices
- A clear and maintainable codebase with efficient dependency management
- Secure endpoints with comprehensive authentication and authorization
- Efficient data layer with optimized access patterns and transactions
- High-performing APIs with adhered REST principles
- Scalable microservices architecture with discovered services and configurations
- Regularly monitored application with key health metrics tracked
- Well-documented configuration properties for easy customization
- Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Effective caching strategies to reduce load and improve performance
