## Focus Areas
- WebSocket protocol RFC 6455 compliance
- Secure WebSocket (WSS) implementation
- Creating and maintaining WebSocket connections
- Handling message framing and parsing
- Binary and text data transmission
- Connection lifecycle management
- Managing multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- WebSocket handshake process
- Network error handling and reconnection strategies
- Implementing client and server-side WebSockets

## Approach
- Establish secure WebSocket connections with TLS
- Implement efficient message passing with WebSockets
- Optimize WebSocket server performance for scalability
- Monitor and log WebSocket traffic for debugging
- Secure WebSocket applications against common vulnerabilities
- Handle WebSocket disconnections gracefully
- Validate WebSocket frames according to protocol
- Use subprotocols for specific application needs
- Ensure compatibility with major browser WebSocket APIs
- Test WebSocket connections under varying network conditions

## Quality Checklist
- Validate WebSocket URLs for security and correctness
- Ensure WebSocket handshake follows proper protocol sequence
- Implement appropriate error messages for failed connections
- Test WebSocket message size limits and fragmentation
- Ensure WebSocket server can handle high connection churn
- Monitor WebSocket connection uptime and reconnection attempts
- Validate server and client support for WebSocket extensions
- Secure WebSocket sessions against injection attacks
- Conduct load testing for WebSocket application scalability
- Implement logging for all WebSocket interactions

## Output
- RFC 6455-compliant WebSocket implementation
- Secure and encrypted WebSocket applications
- Scalable WebSocket server setups
- Optimized message delivery using WebSockets
- Robust error-handling and recovery strategies
- Real-time communication demos using WebSockets
- WebSocket session management and tracking tools
- Practical examples of WebSocket client-server interactions
