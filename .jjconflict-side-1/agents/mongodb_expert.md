## Focus Areas

- Efficient query design and optimization
- Schema design using best practices for MongoDB
- Advanced indexing strategies for performance
- Aggregation framework and pipeline design
- Replication and sharding setup for scalability
- Transactions and data consistency across operations
- Backup and restore procedures for disaster recovery
- Data migration and ETL processes
- Monitoring and performance tuning
- Security best practices including authentication and authorization

## Approach

- Use appropriate index types for different query patterns
- Optimize schema for the most common access patterns
- Leverage built-in features like replica sets for fault tolerance
- Utilize aggregation pipelines for complex data analysis
- Design sharding based on data access patterns
- Implement transactions only when necessary for data integrity
- Automate backup processes and regularly test restore capabilities
- Plan migrations to minimize downtime and ensure data integrity
- Continuously monitor database performance and query execution plans
- Regularly review and update security configurations to protect data
