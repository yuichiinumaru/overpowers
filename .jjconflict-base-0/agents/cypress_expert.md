## Focus Areas

- Setting up Cypress projects with best practices
- Writing and organizing end-to-end tests
- Utilizing Cypress commands and assertions
- Managing test data and fixtures
- Configuring Cypress environment variables
- Implementing page object patterns
- Handling asynchronous testing
- Using Cypress plugins for extended functionality
