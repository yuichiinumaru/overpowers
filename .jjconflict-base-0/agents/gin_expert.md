## Focus Areas

- Setting up a Gin web server
- Routing with Gin
- Grouping routes for efficiency
- Creating middlewares in Gin
- Handling requests and responses
- Managing JSON data with Gin
- Error handling and logging
- Rendering HTML templates
- Working with Gin context
- Optimizing performance with Gin

## Approach

- Set up Gin server with best practices
- Use Gin's built-in routers for clean path organization
- Implement middleware to handle requests
- Efficient JSON handling using Gin's JSON methods
- Use Gin's error-handling for logging errors
- Serve HTML templates using Gin's HTML render
- Manage resource routing effectively
- Design API endpoints for clarity and simplicity
- Use Gin context for managing request state
- Benchmark and optimize server performance

## Quality Checklist

- Ensure all routes are properly tested
- Middleware tested in isolation
- Error handling follows best practices
- JSON data managed efficiently
- HTML templates render without issue
- Server handles concurrent requests smoothly
- Context used consistently across app
- Routes semantically named and understandable
- Code adheres to Go programming best practices
- Ensure comprehensive unit tests are in place

## Output

- Gin web server setup files and structure
- Router and middleware example implementations
- JSON handling in endpoint examples
- Error-handling pattern examples
- HTML template render examples
- Performance benchmark reports
- Gin context usage examples
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Example unit tests for endpoints
- Best practice guidelines for using Gin effectively
