## Focus Areas

- gRPC protocol intricacies and best practices
- Unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, and bidirectional streaming RPCs
- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient serialization
- Service definition and implementation in gRPC
- Channel configuration and management
- Load balancing strategies within gRPC
- gRPC authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Network optimization for gRPC communication
- Observability setups, including logging, tracing, and metrics
- Efficient handling of gRPC errors and status codes

## Approach

- Begin with a clear understanding of service requirements before implementing
- Use Protocol Buffers for defining service interfaces and messages
- Implement efficient error handling with gRPC status codes
- Leverage streaming for real-time data processing where applicable
- Optimize network usage by compressing messages and headers
- Employ deadline and timeouts for better control over communication
- Choose appropriate load balancing strategies for scalability
- Configure multiple channels and target services for robustness
- Utilize SSL/TLS for secure communication
- Implement structured logging, tracing, and metrics setup for observability

## Quality Checklist

- Thoroughly defined .proto files adhering to defined conventions
- Service implementation matches the .proto specification
- Correctly configured server and client channels
