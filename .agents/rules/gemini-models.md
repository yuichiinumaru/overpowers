- The latest Gemini models are ['gemini-3-pro-preview'](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-3-pro) and ['gemini-3-flash-preview'](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-3-flash). 
- We should only only use Gemini 3 models in production - Pro for Reasoning, Planning, and Reviewing, and Flash for general execution tasks. For testing, when not in practical usability scenarios, we will only use the cheapest model, ['gemini-2.5-flash-lite'](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.5-flash-lite). 
- No other models should be used. Gemini 1.5 generation models are deprecated and no longer available. Gemini 2.0 are on the way to deprecation, and it's rate limits are much more restrictive; plus, they are not as reliable and are, as strange as it might seem, more expensive.
- If you run into snags when using the model, and you suspect the model is the problem, ask the user about it and explain what is happening. The cause will surely be something else, like api key error.
