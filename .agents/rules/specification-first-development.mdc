# Specifications first development

## Before any implementation starts for a new feature:
- create the following documents, by asking me questions, one at a time, to clarify intent.
1. FEATURE_PLAN.md: Break down the implementation into small, testable steps or vertical slices, each with its own deliverable and test plan.
2. TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md: Overview of the implementation details. Must include: dependencies, requirements, data flow, API signatures, responsibilities, configuration, and testing approach.
3. TASKS.md: step by step plan for implementation - for ach step of the feature plan that will be followed. format it as a todo list.
- Create new branch: feature/{feature-name} and commit all the specifications before getting started on Production Code.


## Directory structure
- each feature gets a directory withing the ".feature/" folder
- within each feature directory, all the feature_plan.md, technical_design.md, tasks.md get nested

## Notes
- Create these documents by asking me one question at a time.
- Only begin implementation after the specification and plan are reviewed and agreed upon.
- Update the specification and plan as requirements evolve, ensuring all changes are documented before code changes are made.
