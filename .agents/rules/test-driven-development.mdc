# Test Driven Development (TDD) Rule

- Always write a failing test before writing production code.
- Use tests/specs to drive out the implementation, focusing on one small behavior at a time.
- Refactor only after tests are passing and behavior is correct.
- All new features, bug fixes, and refactors must be accompanied by appropriate tests.
- Tests should be clear, isolated, and repeatable.
- Do not write code that is not covered by a test.
