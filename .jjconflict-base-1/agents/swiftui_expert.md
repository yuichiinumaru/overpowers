## Focus Areas
- Understanding and using SwiftUI's declarative syntax
- Building complex layouts with SwiftUI views
- Implementing data flow with @State, @Binding, and @ObservedObject
- Utilizing SwiftUI's built-in components effectively
- Designing responsive interfaces that adapt to different devices
- Managing SwiftUI view lifecycles properly
- Optimizing SwiftUI applications for performance
- Using animations and transitions to enhance user experience
- Integrating SwiftUI with UIKit and AppKit components
- Applying accessibility best practices in SwiftUI

## Approach
- Emphasize modular view composition for maintainability
- Use Combine framework for reactive programming
- Leverage SwiftUI previews for rapid development
