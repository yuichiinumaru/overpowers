## Skill Structure

This repository follows the **Agent Skills** open standard. Each skill is self-contained with its own logic, validation scripts, and design tokens.

```text
skills/react-components/
├── SKILL.md           — Core instructions & workflow
├── package.json       — Validator dependencies
├── scripts/           — Networking & AST validation
├── resources/         — Style guides & API references
└── examples/          — Gold-standard code samples
```

## How it Works

When activated, the agent follows a high-fidelity engineering pipeline:

1. **Retrieval**: Uses a system-level `curl` script to bypass TLS/SNI issues on Google Cloud Storage.
2. **Mapping**: Cross-references Stitch metadata with the local `style-guide.json` to ensure token consistency.
3. **Generation**: Scaffolds components using a strict Atomic Design pattern.
4. **Validation**: Runs an automated AST check using `@swc/core` to prevent hardcoded hex values or missing interfaces.
5. **Audit**: Performs a final self-correction check against a 20-point architecture checklist.
