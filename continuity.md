# Overpowers Continuity Ledger

## Session: 2026-05-24 - BMAD & Safety Integration
**Operator**: Jules (Agent)
**Focus**: Absorption of BMAD Architecture, TEA Testing, and Safety Layers

### 🟢 Global State
- **Safety**: 🟢 Protected. Destructive command blocker active (regex-based).
- **Knowledge**: 🟢 Expanded. Added `docs/knowledge/testing/`.
- **Agents**: Added `Murat` (Test), `Link` (Game Dev), `Dr. Quinn` (Creative).
## Session: 2026-05-24 - Mothership Integration (References)
**Operator**: Jules (Agent)
**Focus**: Integration of features from 7 reference repositories

### 🟢 Global State
- **Agents**: Upgraded Sisyphus, Metis, Librarian, Oracle with OhMyOpenCode logic.
- **Skills**: Ported 6 high-value skills from Moltbot (Discord, Slack, etc.).
- **Workflows**: Integrated Compound Product Cycle (`scripts/compound/`).
- **Docs**: Added Memory Research and Sandbox Protocols.

### 🔄 Active Contexts
| Component | Status | Notes |
|:----------|:-------|:------|
| **Testing** | 🟢 Expert | "Murat" agent + Network Monitor skill available |
| **Safety** | 🟢 Hardened | `rm -rf` and CI/CD destructive ops are blocked |
| **Architecture**| 🟢 Evolved | "Knowledge Graph" pattern adopted for domain docs |

### ⏭️ Next Actions
1.  **Refine**: Test the `destructive-command-blocker` with more edge cases.
2.  **Expand**: Import more knowledge fragments for Game Dev and Creative domains.
| **Sisyphus** | 🟢 Upgraded | Now uses "Phase 0-3" logic from OhMyOpenCode |
| **Workflows** | 🟢 New | Compound Product Cycle available in `scripts/compound/` |
| **Safety** | 🟢 Enhanced | Added Sandbox Guidelines and NPM+1Password protocols |

### ⏭️ Next Actions
1.  **Memory**: Implement `sqlite-vec` memory system based on `docs/research/moltbot-memory.md`.
2.  **Sandbox**: Implement the `Execution Lanes` logic in a shared script.
3.  **Compound**: Run a real test of `auto-compound.sh`.
