# Overpowers: Core Identity & Structure

**Overpowers** is a consolidated, opinionated, and massively expanded toolkit for OpenCode/Claude Code, maintained by Yuichi Inumaru. It is a fork of "Superpowers" by Jesse Vincent.

## Key Stats (as of Jan 2026)
*   **Agents**: 390+ (Specialized AI personas)
*   **Skills**: 149+ (Complex workflow automations)
*   **Commands**: 230+ (Shorthand operations)
*   **Scripts**: 90 (DevOps & automation helpers)
*   **Hooks**: 29 (Pre/post action notifications)
*   **Services**: 13 (External integrations)

## Directory Structure
*   `agents/`: Markdown definitions of agents.
*   `skills/`: Directories containing `SKILL.md` (Antigravity/OpenCode skills).
*   `commands/`: Markdown files acting as shorthand instructions.
*   `scripts/`: Bash and Python automation scripts.
*   `workflows/`: Guides for complex multi-step processes.
*   `personas/`: Pre-configured MCP bundles (e.g., `devops-engineer`).
*   `packages/`: Submodules like `jules-swarm`.
*   `.opencode/`: Plugin configuration.

## Core Philosophy
*   **Centralization**: Consolidates agents, skills, and workflows in one repo.
*   **Orchestration**: Heavy emphasis on multi-agent chaining (e.g., Sisyphus, Prometheus).
*   **Opinionated**: Specific conventions for naming and structure.
*   **"Nuclear" Capability**: Methods to install/deploy *everything* at once.
