# Skill Evaluator (WIP)

Evaluates skills against Anthropic's official best practices for agent skill authoring. Produces structured evaluation reports with scores and actionable recommendations.

## Quick Start

1. Read the skill's SKILL.md and understand its purpose
2. Run automated validation: `scripts/validate_skill.py <skill-path>`
3. Perform manual evaluation against criteria below
4. Generate evaluation report with scores and recommendations

## Evaluation Workflow

### Step 1: Automated Validation

Run the validation script first:

```bash
scripts/validate_skill.py <path/to/skill>
```

This checks:
- SKILL.md exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- Name follows conventions (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
- Description is present and under 1024 chars
- Body is under 500 lines
- File references are one-level deep

### Step 2: Manual Evaluation

Evaluate each dimension and assign a score (1-5):

#### A. Naming (Weight: 10%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Gerund form (-ing), clear purpose, memorable |
| 4 | Descriptive, follows conventions |
| 3 | Acceptable but could be clearer |
| 2 | Vague or misleading |
| 1 | Violates naming rules |

**Rules**: Max 64 chars, lowercase + numbers + hyphens only, no reserved words (anthropic, claude), no XML tags.

**Good**: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`, `building-dashboards`
**Bad**: `pdf`, `my-skill`, `ClaudeHelper`, `anthropic-tools`

#### B. Description (Weight: 20%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear functionality + specific activation triggers + third person |
| 4 | Good description with some triggers |
| 3 | Adequate but missing triggers or vague |
| 2 | Too brief or unclear purpose |
| 1 | Missing or unhelpful |

**Must include**: What the skill does AND when to use it.
**Good**: "Extracts text from PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents for text extraction, form parsing, or content analysis."
**Bad**: "A skill for PDFs." or "Helps with documents."

#### C. Content Quality (Weight: 30%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Concise, assumes Claude intelligence, actionable instructions |
| 4 | Generally good, minor verbosity |
| 3 | Some unnecessary explanations or redundancy |
| 2 | Overly verbose or confusing |
| 1 | Bloated, explains obvious concepts |

**Ask**: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" Remove anything Claude already knows.

#### D. Structure & Organization (Weight: 25%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Excellent progressive disclosure, clear navigation, optimal length |
| 4 | Good organization, appropriate file splits |
| 3 | Acceptable but could be better organized |
| 2 | Poor organization, missing references, or bloated SKILL.md |
| 1 | No structure, everything dumped in SKILL.md |

**Check**:
- SKILL.md under 500 lines
- References are one-level deep (no nested chains)
- Long reference files (>100 lines) have table of contents
- Uses forward slashes in all paths

#### E. Degrees of Freedom (Weight: 10%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Perfect match: high freedom for flexible tasks, low for fragile operations |
| 4 | Generally appropriate freedom levels |
| 3 | Acceptable but could be better calibrated |
| 2 | Mismatched: too rigid or too loose |
| 1 | Completely wrong freedom level for the task type |

**Guideline**:
- High freedom (text): Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent
- Medium freedom (parameterized): Preferred pattern exists, some variation OK
- Low freedom (specific scripts): Fragile operations, exact sequence required

#### F. Anti-Pattern Check (Weight: 5%)

Deduct points for each anti-pattern found:

- [ ] Too many options without clear recommendation (-1)
- [ ] Time-sensitive information with date conditionals (-1)
- [ ] Inconsistent terminology (-1)
- [ ] Windows-style paths (backslashes) (-1)
- [ ] Deeply nested references (more than one level) (-2)
- [ ] Scripts that punt error handling to Claude (-1)
- [ ] Magic numbers without justification (-1)

### Step 3: Generate Report

Use this template:

```markdown
# Skill Evaluation Report: [skill-name]

## Summary
- **Overall Score**: X.X/5.0
- **Recommendation**: [Ready for publication / Needs minor improvements / Needs major revision]

## Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Naming | X/5 | 10% | X.XX |
| Description | X/5 | 20% | X.XX |
| Content Quality | X/5 | 30% | X.XX |
| Structure | X/5 | 25% | X.XX |
| Degrees of Freedom | X/5 | 10% | X.XX |
| Anti-Patterns | X/5 | 5% | X.XX |
| **Total** | | 100% | **X.XX** |

## Strengths
- [List 2-3 things done well]

## Areas for Improvement
