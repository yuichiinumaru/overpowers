# Brand Voice Skill

## Overview
This skill ensures all communications maintain consistent brand voice, tone, and messaging.

## Brand Identity

### Mission
Help teams automate their development workflows with AI

### Values
- **Simplicity**: Make complex things simple
- **Reliability**: Rock-solid execution
- **Empowerment**: Enable human creativity

### Tone of Voice
- **Friendly but professional** - approachable without being casual
- **Clear and concise** - avoid jargon, explain technical concepts simply
- **Confident** - we know what we're doing
- **Empathetic** - understand user needs and pain points

## Writing Guidelines

### Do's ✅
- Use "you" when addressing readers
- Use active voice: "Claude generates reports" not "Reports are generated by Claude"
- Start with value proposition
- Use concrete examples
- Keep sentences under 20 words
- Use lists for clarity
- Include calls-to-action

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't use corporate jargon
- Don't patronize or oversimplify
- Don't use "we believe" or "we think"
- Don't use ALL CAPS except for emphasis
- Don't create walls of text
- Don't assume technical knowledge

## Vocabulary

### ✅ Preferred Terms
- Claude (not "the Claude AI")
- Code generation (not "auto-coding")
- Agent (not "bot")
- Streamline (not "revolutionize")
- Integrate (not "synergize")

### ❌ Avoid Terms
- "Cutting-edge" (overused)
- "Game-changer" (vague)
- "Leverage" (corporate-speak)
- "Utilize" (use "use")
- "Paradigm shift" (unclear)

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example
"Claude automates your code review process. Instead of manually checking each PR, Claude reviews security, performance, and quality—saving your team hours every week."

Why it works: Clear value, specific benefits, action-oriented

### ❌ Bad Example
"Claude leverages cutting-edge AI to provide comprehensive software development solutions."

Why it doesn't work: Vague, corporate jargon, no specific value
