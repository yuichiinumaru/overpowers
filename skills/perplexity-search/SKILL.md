# Perplexity AI Search

Web search with AI-powered answers, deep research, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

## When to Use

- Direct web search for ranked results (no AI synthesis)
- AI-synthesized research with citations
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for complex decisions
- Deep comprehensive research on topics

## Models (2025)

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `sonar` | Lightweight search with grounding |
| `sonar-pro` | Advanced search for complex queries |
| `sonar-reasoning-pro` | Chain of thought reasoning |
| `sonar-deep-research` | Expert-level exhaustive research |

## Usage

### Quick question (AI answer)
```bash
uv run python scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py \
    --ask "What is the latest version of Python?"
```

### Direct web search (ranked results, no AI)
```bash
uv run python scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py \
    --search "SQLite graph database patterns" \
    --max-results 5 \
    --recency week
```

### AI-synthesized research
```bash
uv run python scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py \
    --research "compare FastAPI vs Django for microservices"
```

### Chain-of-thought reasoning
```bash
uv run python scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py \
    --reason "should I use Neo4j or SQLite for small graph under 10k nodes?"
```

### Deep comprehensive research
```bash
uv run python scripts/mcp/perplexity_search.py \
    --deep "state of AI agent observability 2025"
```
