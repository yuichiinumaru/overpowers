# Clinical Decision Support Documents

## Description

Generate professional clinical decision support (CDS) documents for pharmaceutical companies, clinical researchers, and medical decision-makers. This skill specializes in analytical, evidence-based documents that inform treatment strategies and drug development:

1. **Patient Cohort Analysis** - Biomarker-stratified group analyses with statistical outcome comparisons
2. **Treatment Recommendation Reports** - Evidence-based clinical guidelines with GRADE grading and decision algorithms

All documents are generated as publication-ready LaTeX/PDF files optimized for pharmaceutical research, regulatory submissions, and clinical guideline development.

**Note:** For individual patient treatment plans at the bedside, use the `treatment-plans` skill instead. This skill focuses on group-level analyses and evidence synthesis for pharmaceutical/research settings.

## Capabilities

- Statistical comparisons between subgroups (hazard ratios, p-values, 95% CI)
- Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests
- Efficacy tables and waterfall plots
- Comparative effectiveness analyses
- Pharmaceutical cohort reporting (trial subgroups, real-world evidence)

**Treatment Recommendation Reports**

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Analyze patient cohorts** stratified by biomarkers, molecular subtypes, or clinical characteristics
- **Generate treatment recommendation reports** with evidence grading for clinical guidelines or pharmaceutical strategies
- **Compare outcomes** between patient subgroups with statistical analysis (survival, response rates, hazard ratios)
- **Produce pharmaceutical research documents** for drug development, clinical trials, or regulatory submissions
- **Develop clinical practice guidelines** with GRADE evidence grading and decision algorithms
- **Document biomarker-guided therapy selection** at the population level (not individual patients)
- **Synthesize evidence** from multiple trials or real-world data sources
- **Create clinical decision algorithms** with flowcharts for treatment sequencing

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Individual patient treatment plans (use `treatment-plans` skill)
- Bedside clinical care documentation (use `treatment-plans` skill)
- Simple patient-specific treatment protocols (use `treatment-plans` skill)

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Every clinical decision support document MUST include at least 1-2 AI-generated figures using the scientific-schematics skill.**

This is not optional. Clinical decision documents require clear visual algorithms. Before finalizing any document:
1. Generate at minimum ONE schematic or diagram (e.g., clinical decision algorithm, treatment pathway, or biomarker stratification tree)
2. For cohort analyses: include patient flow diagram
3. For treatment recommendations: include decision flowchart

**How to generate figures:**
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate AI-powered publication-quality diagrams
- Simply describe your desired diagram in natural language
- Nano Banana Pro will automatically generate, review, and refine the schematic

**How to generate schematics:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

The AI will automatically:
- Create publication-quality images with proper formatting
- Review and refine through multiple iterations
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind-friendly, high contrast)
- Save outputs in the figures/ directory

**When to add schematics:**
- Clinical decision algorithm flowcharts
- Treatment pathway diagrams
- Biomarker stratification trees
- Patient cohort flow diagrams (CONSORT-style)
- Survival curve visualizations
- Molecular mechanism diagrams
- Any complex concept that benefits from visualization

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the scientific-schematics skill documentation.

## Best Practices

### For Cohort Analyses

1. **Patient Selection Transparency**: Clearly document inclusion/exclusion criteria, patient flow, and reasons for exclusions
2. **Biomarker Clarity**: Specify assay methods, platforms (e.g., FoundationOne, Caris), cut-points, and validation status
3. **Statistical Rigor**: 
   - Report hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals, not just p-values
   - Include median follow-up time for survival analyses
   - Specify statistical tests used (log-rank, Cox regression, Fisher's exact)
   - Account for multiple comparisons when appropriate
4. **Outcome Definitions**: Use standard criteria:
   - Response: RECIST 1.1, iRECIST for immunotherapy
   - Adverse events: CTCAE version 5.0
   - Performance status: ECOG or Karnofsky
5. **Survival Data Presentation**:
   - Median OS/PFS with 95% CI
   - Landmark survival rates (6-month, 12-month, 24-month)
   - Number at risk tables below Kaplan-Meier curves
   - Censoring clearly indicated
6. **Subgroup Analyses**: Pre-specify subgroups; clearly label exploratory vs pre-planned analyses
7. **Data Completeness**: Report missing data and how it was handled

### For Treatment Recommendation Reports

1. **Evidence Grading Transparency**: 
   - Use GRADE system consistently (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2C)
   - Document rationale for each grade
   - Clearly state quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low)
2. **Comprehensive Evidence Review**: 
   - Include phase 3 randomized trials as primary evidence
   - Supplement with phase 2 data for emerging therapies
   - Note real-world evidence and meta-analyses
   - Cite trial names (e.g., KEYNOTE-189, CheckMate-227)
3. **Biomarker-Guided Recommendations**:
   - Link specific biomarkers to therapy recommendations
   - Specify testing methods and validated assays
   - Include FDA/EMA approval status for companion diagnostics
4. **Clinical Actionability**: Every recommendation should have clear implementation guidance
5. **Decision Algorithm Clarity**: TikZ flowcharts should be unambiguous with clear yes/no decision points
6. **Special Populations**: Address elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, pregnancy, drug interactions
7. **Monitoring Guidance**: Specify safety labs, imaging, and frequency
8. **Update Frequency**: Date recommendations and plan for periodic updates

### General Best Practices

1. **First Page Executive Summary (MANDATORY)**: 
   - ALWAYS create a complete executive summary on page 1 that spans the entire first page
   - Use 3-5 colored tcolorbox elements to highlight key findings
   - No table of contents or detailed sections on page 1
   - Use `\thispagestyle{empty}` and end with `\newpage`
   - This is the single most important page - it should be scannable in 60 seconds
2. **De-identification**: Remove all 18 HIPAA identifiers before document generation (Safe Harbor method)
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Include confidentiality notices for proprietary pharmaceutical data
4. **Publication-Ready Formatting**: Use 0.5in margins, professional fonts, color-coded sections
5. **Reproducibility**: Document all statistical methods to enable replication
6. **Conflict of Interest**: Disclose pharmaceutical funding or relationships when applicable
7. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use colored boxes consistently (blue=data, green=biomarkers, yellow/orange=recommendations, red=warnings)
