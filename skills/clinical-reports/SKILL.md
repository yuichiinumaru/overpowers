# Clinical Report Writing

## Overview

Clinical report writing is the process of documenting medical information with precision, accuracy, and compliance with regulatory standards. This skill covers four major categories of clinical reports: case reports for journal publication, diagnostic reports for clinical practice, clinical trial reports for regulatory submission, and patient documentation for medical records. Apply this skill for healthcare documentation, research dissemination, and regulatory compliance.

**Critical Principle: Clinical reports must be accurate, complete, objective, and compliant with applicable regulations (HIPAA, FDA, ICH-GCP).** Patient privacy and data integrity are paramount. All clinical documentation must support evidence-based decision-making and meet professional standards.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Writing clinical case reports for journal submission (CARE guidelines)
- Creating diagnostic reports (radiology, pathology, laboratory)
- Documenting clinical trial data and adverse events
- Preparing clinical study reports (CSR) for regulatory submission
- Writing patient progress notes, SOAP notes, and clinical summaries
- Drafting discharge summaries, H&P documents, or consultation notes
- Ensuring HIPAA compliance and proper de-identification
- Validating clinical documentation for completeness and accuracy
- Preparing serious adverse event (SAE) reports
- Creating data safety monitoring board (DSMB) reports

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Every clinical report MUST include at least 1 AI-generated figure using the scientific-schematics skill.**

This is not optional. Clinical reports benefit greatly from visual elements. Before finalizing any document:
1. Generate at minimum ONE schematic or diagram (e.g., patient timeline, diagnostic algorithm, or treatment workflow)
2. For case reports: include clinical progression timeline
3. For trial reports: include CONSORT flow diagram

**How to generate figures:**
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate AI-powered publication-quality diagrams
- Simply describe your desired diagram in natural language
- Nano Banana Pro will automatically generate, review, and refine the schematic

**How to generate schematics:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

The AI will automatically:
- Create publication-quality images with proper formatting
- Review and refine through multiple iterations
- Ensure accessibility (colorblind-friendly, high contrast)
- Save outputs in the figures/ directory

**When to add schematics:**
- Patient case timelines and clinical progression diagrams
- Diagnostic algorithm flowcharts
- Treatment protocol workflows
- Anatomical diagrams for case reports
- Clinical trial participant flow diagrams (CONSORT)
- Adverse event classification trees
- Any complex concept that benefits from visualization

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the scientific-schematics skill documentation.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Case Reports
- **Privacy violations**: Inadequate de-identification or missing consent
- **Lack of novelty**: Reporting common or well-documented cases
- **Insufficient detail**: Missing key clinical information
- **Poor literature review**: Failure to contextualize within existing knowledge
- **Overgeneralization**: Drawing broad conclusions from single case

### Diagnostic Reports
- **Vague language**: Using ambiguous terms like "unremarkable" without specifics
- **Incomplete comparison**: Not reviewing prior imaging
- **Missing clinical correlation**: Failing to answer clinical question
- **Technical jargon**: Overuse of terminology without explanation
- **Delayed critical value notification**: Not communicating urgent findings

### Clinical Trial Reports
- **Late reporting**: Missing regulatory deadlines for SAE reporting
- **Incomplete causality**: Inadequate causality assessment
- **Data inconsistencies**: Discrepancies between data sources
- **Protocol deviations**: Unreported or inadequately documented deviations
- **Selective reporting**: Omitting negative or unfavorable results

### Patient Documentation
- **Illegibility**: Poor handwriting in paper records
- **Copy-forward errors**: Propagating outdated information
- **Insufficient detail**: Vague or incomplete documentation affecting billing
- **Lack of medical necessity**: Not documenting indication for services
- **Missing signatures**: Unsigned or undated notes
