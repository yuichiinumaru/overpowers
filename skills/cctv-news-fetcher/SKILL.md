# CCTV News Fetcher

This skill allows you to fetch summary titles and content from the CCTV News Broadcast for any specific date.

## Usage

You can ask the agent to:
- "Fetch CCTV news for 20250210"
- "Give me the news highlights for yesterday"

## Instructions

When the user asks for news from a specific date:
1. Format the date as `YYYYMMDD`. If the user says "yesterday" or "today", calculate the date relative to the current local time.
2. Execute the script at `{baseDir}/scripts/news_crawler.js` using `bun` or `node`.
   - Command: `bun {baseDir}/scripts/news_crawler.js <YYYYMMDD>`
3. Parse the JSON output and summarize it for the user. Group news by "Domestic" and "International" if possible based on titles, or just list the highlights.

## Configuration

The skill depends on `node-html-parser`.
Ensure `bun` is installed in the environment.
