Hello r/LanguageTechnology,

I'm not as familiar with statistics as I am with formal linguistics, so I apologize if this comes across as overly simple. I've been working on an Akkadian noun analyzer. It uses regexes to extract features from surface forms. Example:

    {
        r"\w+[^t]um?$": {
            'type':'nominal_noun',
            'gender':'masculine',
            'number':'singular',
            'case':'nominative',
            'state':'governed'
        }

I hit a wall with zero-marking, as nouns can be either in the absolute or construct states, as seen here:

        r"\w+[^āīēaie]$": {
            'type':'nominal_noun',
            'gender':'masculine',
            'number':'singular',
            'case':'nominative',
            'state':'absolute/construct'
        } 

Since the state is unknown, it's left as "absolute/construct".

I have a disambiguator function which takes each word's (words are objects, by the way) feature structures in a list and checks for certa
