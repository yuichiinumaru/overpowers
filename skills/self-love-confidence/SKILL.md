# Self-Love & Confidence

Build unshakeable self-worth through daily practices, wins logging, and inner critic reframing.

## What it does

This skill transforms self-doubt into self-trust through four core practices:

- **Affirmations**: Personalized affirmations across five dimensions of worth (self-worth, capability, body, relationships, growth)
- **Wins Logging**: Capture daily wins—big and small—to counteract the brain's negativity bias
- **Inner Critic Reframing**: Convert harsh self-talk into compassionate, realistic self-dialogue
- **Confidence Tracking**: Monitor confidence levels over time to spot patterns and celebrate progress

## Usage

### Daily Affirmation
Start your morning with a personalized affirmation from your chosen category. The skill adapts affirmations based on your recent logs and patterns.

**Trigger:** "Give me an affirmation" or "self love practice"

### Log a Win
Record a win—any accomplishment, no matter size. Won a small argument with your inner critic? Shipped a feature? Drank enough water? Log it. The wins compound into visible proof of your capability.

**Trigger:** "Log a win" or "I accomplished..."

### Reframe Thought
Caught yourself in harsh self-talk? Feed it to the skill. It will help you see the thought as data, not truth, and reframe it into something grounded and compassionate.

**Trigger:** "Reframe this thought" or "I'm feeling insecure about..."

### Confidence Check
Quick pulse on your current confidence level (1-10) across dimensions. Track shifts and what caused them.

**Trigger:** "Confidence check" or "How confident am I today?"

### Review Progress
See your wins, affirmation history, and confidence trend over the past week, month, or custom range. Spot patterns. Celebrate growth.

**Trigger:** "Show my progress" or "Review my wins"

## Affirmation Categories

The skill offers affirmations across five dimensions:

- **Self-Worth**: Core belief in your inherent value, independent of achievement
- **Capability**: Trust in your ability to learn, solve, and grow
- **Body**: Gratitude and respect for your physical self
- **Relationships**: Healthy boundaries and deserving of good connection
- **Growth**: Embracing challenge and seeing failure as feedback

## Tips

1. **Consistency beats intensity.** One affirmation daily is more powerful than ten sporadic ones. The brain needs repetition to rewire.

2. **Logs are proof.** When doubt creeps in, scroll your wins. Your brain forgot what you accomplished—remind it.

3. **Reframe regularly.** The inner critic is a reflex. Catching and reframing each thought weakens its grip over time.

4. **Small wins count.** Logging "I drank water" is not trivial. It's evidence that you follow through on commitments to yourself.

5. **All data stays local on your machine.** Your affirmations, wins, and inner critic conversations never leave your device. Privacy by design.
