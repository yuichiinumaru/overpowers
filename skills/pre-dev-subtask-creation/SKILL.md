# Subtask Creation - Bite-Sized, Zero-Context Steps

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation subtasks assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase. Each subtask breaks down into 2-5 minute steps following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. Complete code, exact commands, explicit verification. **DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.**

**Save subtasks to:** `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/subtasks/T-[task-id]/ST-[task-id]-[number]-[description].md`

## Foundational Principle

**Every subtask must be completable by anyone with zero context about the system.**

Requiring context creates bottlenecks, onboarding friction, and integration failures.

**Subtasks answer**: Exactly what to create/modify, with complete code and verification.
**Subtasks never answer**: Why the system works this way (context is removed).

## Bite-Sized Step Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Subtask Document Structure

**Header (required):**

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Title | `# ST-[task-id]-[number]: [Subtask Name]` |
| Agent Note | `> **For Agents:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use ring:executing-plans` |
| Goal | One sentence describing what this builds |
| Prerequisites | Verification commands with expected output |
| Files | Create: `exact/path`, Modify: `exact/path:lines`, Test: `tests/path` |

**Step Structure (TDD Cycle):**

| Step | Content |
|------|---------|
| Step 1: Write failing test | Complete test file with imports |
| Step 2: Run test to verify fail | Command + expected failure output |
| Step 3: Write minimal implementation | Complete implementation file |
| Step 4: Run test to verify pass | Command + expected success output |
| Step 5: Update exports (if needed) | Exact modification to index files |
| Step 6: Verify type checking | Command + expected output |
| Step 7: Commit | Exact git commands with message |
| Rollback | Exact commands to undo if issues |

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include in Subtasks
Exact file paths (absolute or from root), complete file contents (if creating), complete code snippets (if modifying), all imports and dependencies, step-by-step TDD cycle (numbered), verification commands (copy-pasteable), expected output (exact), rollback procedures (exact commands), prerequisites (what must exist first)

### ❌ NEVER Include in Subtasks
Placeholders: "...", "TODO", "implement here"; vague instructions: "update the service", "add validation"; assumptions: "assuming setup is done"; context requirements: "you need to understand X first"; incomplete code: "add the rest yourself"; missing imports: "import necessary packages"; undefined success: "make sure it works"; no verification: "test it manually"

<cannot_skip>

### ⛔ HARD GATE: lib-commons in Go Code Examples

MUST: For Go projects, code examples use lib-commons instead of custom utilities.

See **[shared-patterns/code-example-standards.md](../shared-patterns/code-example-standards.md)** for:
- Complete list of what lib-commons provides
- Forbidden patterns (custom loggers, config loaders, HTTP helpers)
- Correct import patterns with `lib` prefix aliases
- Anti-rationalization table

**Quick Reference - DO NOT Create Custom:**

| Category | Use lib-commons |
|----------|-----------------|
| Logging | `libLog "github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v2/commons/log"` |
| Config | `libCommons.SetConfigFromEnvVars()` |
| HTTP | `libHTTP "github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v2/commons/net/http"` |
| Telemetry | `libOpentelemetry "github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v2/commons/opentelemetry"` |
| PostgreSQL | `libPostgres "github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v2/commons/postgres"` |

MUST NOT: Create custom logger, config loader, or HTTP helper in subtasks—use lib-commons.

</cannot_skip>

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The developer will figure out imports" | Imports are context. Provide them explicitly. |
| "TODO comments are fine for simple parts" | TODOs require decisions. Make them now. |
| "They'll know which service to update" | They won't. Specify the exact file path. |
| "The verification steps are obvious" | Obvious ≠ documented. Write exact commands. |
| "Rollback isn't needed for simple changes" | Simple changes fail too. Always provide rollback. |
| "This needs system understanding" | Then you haven't removed context. Simplify more. |
| "I'll provide the template, they fill it" | Templates are incomplete. Provide full code. |
| "The subtask description explains it" | Descriptions need interpretation. Give exact steps. |
| "They can look at similar code for reference" | That's context. Make subtask self-contained. |
| "This is too detailed, we're not that formal" | Detailed = parallelizable = faster. Be detailed. |
| "Steps are too small, feels like hand-holding" | Small steps = verifiable progress. Stay small. |
| "Custom logger is simpler for this example" | Examples teach patterns. Teach lib-commons. |
| "lib-commons import is too verbose" | Verbosity shows correct dependencies. Keep it. |
| "I'll use lib-commons in the real code" | Subtask is real code. Use lib-commons now. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in a subtask, **STOP and rewrite**:

- Code placeholders: `...`, `// TODO`, `// implement X here`
- Vague file references: "the user service", "the auth module"
- Assumption phrases: "assuming you have", "make sure you"
- Incomplete imports: "import required packages"
- Missing paths: Not specifying where files go
- Undefined verification: "test that it works"
- Steps longer than 5 minutes
- Context dependencies: "you need to understand X"
- No TDD cycle in implementation steps
- Use `libZap.NewLogger()` instead of custom `func NewLogger()` (Go)
- Use `libCommons.SetConfigFromEnvVars()` instead of scattered `os.Getenv()` (Go)
- Use `libHTTP` utilities instead of custom `func JSONResponse()` (Go)
- Check lib-commons first before creating files in `utils/`, `helpers/`, `pkg/common/` (Go)

**When you catch yourself**: Expand the subtask until it's completely self-contained.

## Gate 8 Validation Checklist

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **Atomicity** | Each step 2-5 minutes; no system architecture understanding required; assignable to anyone |
| **Completeness** | All code provided in full; all file paths explicit; all imports listed; all prerequisites documented; TDD cycle followed |
| **Verifiability** | Test commands copy-pasteable; expected output exact; commands run from project root |
| **Reversibility** | Rollback commands provided; rollback doesn't require system knowledge |

**Gate Result:** ✅ PASS → Ready for implementation | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (add details) | ❌ FAIL (decompose further)

## Confidence Scoring

| Factor | Points | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Step Atomicity | 0-30 | All 2-5 minutes: 30, Most sized right: 20, Too large/vague: 10 |
| Code Completeness | 0-30 | Zero placeholders: 30, Mostly complete: 15, Significant TODOs: 5 |
| Context Independence | 0-25 | Anyone can execute: 25, Minor context: 15, Significant knowledge: 5 |
| TDD Coverage | 0-15 | All RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: 15, Most have tests: 10, Limited: 5 |

**Action:** 80+ autonomous | 50-79 present options | <50 ask about structure

## Execution Handoff

After creating subtasks, offer execution choice:

**"Subtasks complete. Two execution options:**
1. **Subagent-Driven** - Fresh subagent per subtask, review between, fast iteration → Use `ring:subagent-driven-development`
2. **Parallel Session** - New session with ring:executing-plans, batch with checkpoints → Use `ring:executing-plans`

**Which approach?"**

## The Bottom Line

**If you wrote a subtask with "TODO" or "..." or "add necessary imports", delete it and rewrite with complete code.**

Subtasks are not instructions. Subtasks are complete, copy-pasteable implementations following TDD.

- "Add validation" is not a step. [Complete validation code with test] is a step.
- "Update the service" is not a step. [Exact file path + exact code changes with test] is a step.
- "Import necessary packages" is not a step. [Complete list of imports] is a step.

Every subtask must be completable by someone who:
- Just joined the team yesterday
- Has never seen the codebase before
- Doesn't know the business domain
- Won't ask questions (you're unavailable)
- Follows TDD religiously

If they can't complete it with zero questions while following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, **it's not atomic enough.**

**Remember: DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.**
