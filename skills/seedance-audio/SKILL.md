## ⚠️ Critical Distinction: Two Separate Tools on the Jimeng Platform

The Jimeng platform hosts **two completely different tools** that both involve lip-sync. Mixing them up is the most common documentation error.

| Tool | Model | Where to find | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **视频生成 (Video Generation)** | **Seedance 2.0** | Jimeng → Video Generation → Seedance 2.0 | Generates full video clips (4–15 s) with native audio-video joint generation. Audio is part of the generated output. |
| **数字人 (Digital Human)** | **OmniHuman-1** | Jimeng → Digital Human | Portrait animation tool — uploads a face image + audio → generates a talking head with precise lip-sync. Has Master/Quick/Standard modes. |

**This skill covers Seedance 2.0 video generation only.**
The Master mode (大师模式), Quick mode (快速模式), Standard mode (标准模式), and OmniHuman-1 engine all belong to the **Digital Human tool** — not Seedance 2.0. Do not import those concepts here.

## How Seedance 2.0 Audio Works

Seedance 2.0 uses a **unified multimodal audio-video joint generation architecture** (统一多模态音视频联合生成架构). Audio and video are generated together — not as separate passes. This is its core architectural difference from older video models.

**What the model generates automatically:**
```
Ambient audio:     environmental sounds matched to visual scene
Background music:  mood-appropriate score matched to visual content
Sound effects:     event-locked sounds (footsteps, impacts, etc.)
Dialogue:          natural speech with lip-sync when characters talk in the prompt
```

**What audio reference input does:**
When you upload an MP3 as `@Audio1`, you are providing a **reference** that influences:
- Rhythm and pacing of the visual edit
- Mood and tonal character of generated audio
- Beat-sync cut timing
- Voice/speech reference for dialogue generation and lip-sync

Audio input does **not** guarantee the model will play your exact uploaded audio unchanged — it treats the file as a reference, not a playback track. (See Failure Mode 1 for the workaround when you need exact audio preservation.)

---

## Platform Audio Constraints (Hard Limits)

Violating these causes silent failure with no error message.

```
Format:       MP3 only.
              WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A are accepted with no error
              but produce no lip-sync or fail silently. #1 silent failure cause.
Duration:     ≤ 15 seconds per audio file. Hard limit.
              Optimal range: 3–8 s for best lip-sync accuracy.
File budget:  Max 3 audio clips per generation (part of the Rule of 12).
Bitrate:      128–320 kbps recommended. Below 64 kbps degrades sync.
Size:         ≤ 10 MB per file.
Noise:        Background noise in audio degrades phoneme recognition.
              Use clean, noise-free recordings.
```

---

## Dialogue and Lip-Sync

Seedance 2.0 generates lip-sync from two pathways:

**Pathway 1 — Text-driven dialogue** (most reliable):
```
Character A says: "We leave at dawn."
Framing: medium close-up, locked-off camera.
Character lips match the dialogue naturally.
```

**Pathway 2 — Audio-driven** (音频驱动):
```
Upload MP3 audio as @Audio1.
In prompt: "Lip-sync matches @Audio1 exactly. Camera: medium close-up, locked."
```

**Key rules for reliable lip-sync:**
- Keep lines short. Long dialogue degrades visual stability.
- Put dialogue in quotes: `Character says: "We leave at dawn."`
- Specify framing: `medium close-up, locked-off camera`
- Remove head/face motion tokens (nodding, turning, shaking) — they compete with the lip engine
- Specify pauses with timing: `"brief pause at 2s, then continues"`

---

## ⚠️ Multi-Character Lip-Sync: Officially Unsolved

ByteDance's own official Seedance 2.0 release blog explicitly states:

> **"Seedance 2.0 仍需继续解决多人口型匹配、偶现音频失真等问题"**
> Translation: "Seedance 2.0 still needs to continue solving multi-person lip-sync matching and occasional audio distortion issues."

This is not a community complaint. It is an official acknowledgment from the Seedance team. Multi-person lip-sync in a single generation is an **open, unresolved problem** in Seedance 2.0 as of Q1 2026.

**What actually happens with multiple characters:**
- The model may animate only one character's mouth
- Both characters may produce garbled or misaligned mouth movements
- Audio routing between two characters is unreliable
- Results are inconsistent even with the same prompt

**The workaround: separate generation + compositing**

This is the field-tested solution used by Douyin creators:

```
STEP 1 — Split dialogue audio by character
  Character A lines → CharA.mp3 (≤8 s each segment, MP3, 128–320 kbps)
  Character B lines → CharB.mp3 (≤8 s each segment, MP3, 128–320 kbps)

STEP 2 — Generate each character separately
  Generation 1: Character A reference image + CharA audio segment 1
    Prompt: "Medium close-up, locked camera. Character A speaks.
             Lip-sync matches @Audio1 exactly. No head rotation."

  Generation 2: Character B reference image + CharB audio segment 1
    Prompt: "Medium close-up, locked camera. Character B listens,
             expression engaged but mouth closed."

  Generation 3: Character B reference image + CharB audio segment 2
    Prompt: "Character B speaks. Lip-sync matches @Audio1. Same framing."

  ...repeat for each dialogue exchange.

STEP 3 — Composite in CapCut / Jianying / Premiere
  - Place both character clips in a PiP (picture-in-picture) layout
  - Apply Linear Mask between the two figure positions
  - Set feather: 15–20% to avoid hard edges
  - When A speaks: A layer = generated video / B layer = static original image
  - When B speaks: swap layers
  - Silent character uses still image = zero extra generation credits
```

**Why this works:**
Each generation has a single face → clean audio routing → reliable sync.
The compositing swap creates the illusion of a two-way conversation without the model ever needing to handle two mouths at once.

## Known Failure Modes and Fixes

These failure patterns are documented from Douyin/Bilibili creator community reports, Q1 2026, and the official ByteDance evaluation.

### Failure 1: Model rewrites or replaces uploaded audio (音频被乱改)

**Symptom**: You upload your own MP3; the generated video plays completely different audio — the model has substituted or altered your content.

**Why it happens**: Seedance's native audio generation engine can override the reference when it detects audio it knows how to generate (ambient, music, SFX). The model treats audio input as a reference signal, not a playback instruction. Competing motion tokens amplify this behavior.

**Fixes (field-tested by Douyin creators — 时间戳反向套路法):**
```
Fix A — Explicit preservation instruction:
  Add to prompt: "Audio @Audio1 plays exactly as uploaded from 0s to end.
                  Do not modify or replace the audio content."

Fix B — Remove competing audio tokens:
  Strip all ambient/SFX/music tokens from the prompt.
  Do not write: "background rain", "jazz music", "street noise"
  These invite the native audio engine to take over.

Fix C — Simplify:
  Reduce prompt to under 50 words total.
  Complex prompts increase the chance of audio substitution.
```

### Failure 2: Lip-sync desync / mouth misalignment

**Causes and fixes:**
```
Cause: Audio too long (>10 s is the practical ceiling, not 15 s)
Fix:   Trim to 3–8 s for best results. The 15 s limit is technical maximum,
       not the sweet spot.

Cause: Noisy audio (background music, reverb, crowd noise in the MP3)
Fix:   Clean the audio before uploading.
       Remove background noise, reverb, and crowd sound.

Cause: Fast speech rate
Fix:   Record at ~80% of natural speaking pace. Slightly slower = better sync.

Cause: Head/face motion tokens in prompt
Fix:   Remove "nodding", "turning head", "looking away" — these compete
       with the phoneme engine. Use "locked camera, neutral expression".

Cause: Multi-speaker audio uploaded for single-character generation
Fix:   Always split audio by speaker before uploading. Never upload a
       conversation track and expect one character to lip-sync it.
```

### Failure 3: Multi-character lip-sync broken

**Root cause**: Confirmed open problem in Seedance 2.0 (ByteDance official admission, Feb 2026).

**Fix**: Use the separate generation + compositing workflow described above. Never attempt dual-character lip-sync in a single generation.

### Failure 4: Silent audio format failure

**Symptom**: Upload succeeds, no error shown, but output has no lip-sync or generic generation failure.

**Cause**: File is not MP3. WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A all fail silently.

**Fix**: Convert to MP3 (128–320 kbps, ≤15 s, ≤10 MB) before uploading.
```
FFmpeg command: ffmpeg -i input.wav -codec:libmp3lame -b:a 192k output.mp3
```

### Failure 5: Occasional audio distortion

**Status**: Officially acknowledged by ByteDance in Seedance 2.0 release notes.
Unpredictable. No reliable prevention method documented yet by community.

**Current mitigation**: If audio distortion occurs, regenerate. Shorter clips (4–6 s) show lower distortion rates in community testing.

### Failure 6: Audio exceeds 15 seconds → fail or truncation

**Fix — Segmented generation pipeline:**
```
1. Split audio at natural pause points into 3–8 s segments (not 15 s slices)
2. Each segment becomes one generation
3. Use the same character reference image across all segments
4. Maintain identical framing, lighting, camera angle in the prompt
5. Stitch in CapCut/Jianying with 0-frame cuts (dissolves break lip continuity)
```

### Failure 7: Voice cloning / Face-to-Voice features

**Status**: Suspended as of February 2026 (ByteDance enforcement — privacy/copyright).
No timeline for restoration announced.

**Current alternative:**
- Use external TTS tools (ElevenLabs, Minimax TTS, etc.) to generate clean speech MP3
- Upload that MP3 as your audio reference

### Failure 8: Real person face uploads blocked

**Status**: Blocked as of Feb 15, 2026 (ByteDance enforcement).

**Workaround:**
- Generate an AI character illustration first (using Jimeng image generation)
- Use that illustration as the character reference
- Do not upload photos of real people

## Sound Layer Structure

Seedance 2.0 generates audio and video jointly. The audio layer influences pacing and cut feel even when not explicitly specified.

```
Ambient bed:      continuous environmental sound
Foreground SFX:   1–2 event-locked sounds
Music cue:        entry time + arc (rising / falling / steady)
Silence design:   deliberate absence — where silence matters most
```

**Compact syntax:**

```
Sound: rain bed + distant train hum.
SFX: chess piece click at 2s.
Music: low piano note enters at 3s, resolves on last frame.
Silence holds final 0.5s.
```

---

## Mix Intent

```
Dialogue scene:   dialogue clean and prominent, music low, ambient subtle
Music-driven:     music leads, ambient secondary, no dialogue
SFX-driven:       environmental sounds prominent, no music
Action:           layered SFX prominent, music rhythmic, no dialogue
Atmospheric:      ambient dominant, sparse SFX, no music or faint drone
```

---

## Dialogue Prompt Syntax

**Single character:**
```
Character A (deep male voice) says: "I told you not to come here."
Framing: medium close-up, locked-off camera.
Lip-sync matches @Audio1 exactly. No head rotation.
```

**Two-character (generate SEPARATELY — see compositing workflow):**
```
Generation 1 (Character A's turn):
  Character A says: "I told you not to come here."
  Character B listens silently, expression neutral.
  [Use Character A reference image only]

Generation 2 (Character B's turn):
  Character B says: "You didn't leave me a choice."
  [Use Character B reference image only]
```

**Timestamp anchoring:**
```
At 0s: character begins speaking quietly.
At 2s: brief pause, character looks down.
At 4s: character resumes with urgency.
Lip-sync follows @Audio1 throughout.
Camera locked, no head rotation.
```

---

## Multi-Language Generation

```
Character speaks in Mandarin: "[dialogue]"
Character speaks in English: "[dialogue]"
Character speaks in Cantonese: "[Cantonese dialogue]"
Character speaks in Sichuan dialect: "[dialect text]"
Character speaks in Japanese: "[dialogue]"
Character speaks in Korean: "[dialogue]"
```

Dialect support confirmed including regional Chinese dialects. 8+ languages supported.

**Best practice**: Use audio reference that matches the written language in the prompt.

---

## Beat-Sync / 卡点 Technique

For music-synced visual editing:

1. Upload scene images + one music reference audio/video
2. Prompt:

```
@Image1 through @Image6 are scene images.
@Audio1 provides rhythm and beat reference.
Cut scene transitions on musical downbeats.
Characters move with energy matching the music tempo.
Visual pacing: fast during chorus, slower during verse.
```

**Beat-sync best practices:**
- 5–7 scene images works best (more = more cuts = more complex choreography)
- Use clearly rhythmic audio (not ambient or atmospheric tracks)
- Short clips (4–8 s) are more reliable than 15 s clips for rhythmic precision
- Beat-sync and dialogue-sync are mutually exclusive in one generation — never mix both

---

## Sound-Driven Timing

Use audio cues to anchor visual events:

```
Sound: thunder crack at 3s.
Visual: lightning illuminates the scene exactly at the thunder crack.
Character flinches at the sound.
```

---

## Agent Gotchas

1. **MP3 only, always.** WAV/AAC/OGG/FLAC/M4A all fail silently. No error message.
2. **15 seconds max per clip. Sweet spot is 3–8 s.** Sync quality drops after 10 s.
3. **Multi-character lip-sync is officially unsolved.** ByteDance said so. Use compositing.
4. **The model treats audio as reference, not playback.** Use timestamp anchoring if you need exact audio preserved.
5. **Clean audio = better sync.** Noisy source degrades phoneme recognition significantly.
6. **Slow the speech.** Slightly slower than natural pace improves sync accuracy.
7. **Remove head motion tokens.** "Nodding", "turning" compete with the lip engine.
8. **Voice clone is suspended** (Feb 2026). Use external TTS instead.
9. **Real face uploads are blocked** (Feb 2026). Use AI-generated character art.
10. **Beat-sync and dialogue are mutually exclusive** in one prompt.
11. **Shorter segments = better sync.** Split long dialogue at natural pauses, not arbitrary cuts.
12. **Maintain consistent framing/lighting across segments** so stitched clips cut invisibly.
13. **Occasional audio distortion is a known bug.** Regenerate if it occurs.
14. **Master/Quick/Standard modes do not exist in Seedance 2.0.** Those belong to the separate Jimeng Digital Human (OmniHuman-1) tool.
