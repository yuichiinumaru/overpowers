  Incidents happen and learnings get lost without proper post-mortems. This gathers
  incident notes and timeline, prompts for root cause analysis, documents action
  items, and saves to 06-Resources/Learnings/ so you build institutional knowledge
  and prevent recurrence.
time_investment: "30-45 minutes per incident"
