# Regulatory Templates - Orchestrator

## Overview

**This skill orchestrates the regulatory template creation workflow through modular sub-skills, managing a 3-gate sequential validation process with dynamic context passing between gates.**

**Architecture:** Modular design with dedicated sub-skills for each phase:
- `regulatory-templates-setup` - Initial configuration and selection
- `regulatory-templates-gate1` - Regulatory compliance analysis and field mapping
- `regulatory-templates-gate2` - Technical validation of mappings
- `regulatory-templates-gate3` - Template file generation (.tpl)

**Template Specifications:** All template specifications are dynamically loaded within gates from centralized configurations. Templates are organized by regulatory authority with cascading selection:

**BACEN (Banco Central):**
- **CADOC:** 4010 (Cadastro), 4016 (Crédito), 4111 (Câmbio)
- **APIX:** 001 (Dados Cadastrais), 002 (Contas e Transações)

**RFB (Receita Federal):**
- **e-Financeira:** evtCadDeclarante, evtAberturaeFinanceira, evtFechamentoeFinanceira, evtMovOpFin, evtMovPP, evtMovOpFinAnual
- **DIMP:** v10 (Movimentação Patrimonial)

**REQUIRED AGENTS:** The sub-skills dispatch specialized agents:
- `finops-analyzer` - For Gates 1-2 and Discussion (regulatory analysis and validation)
- `finops-automation` - For Gate 3 (template file generation)

---

## Foundational Principle

**Brazilian regulatory compliance (BACEN, RFB) has zero margin for error.**

This isn't hyperbole:
- BACEN penalties for incorrect submissions: R$10,000 - R$500,000 + license sanctions
- RFB penalties for e-Financeira errors: Criminal liability for false declarations
- Template errors are discovered during audits, often months after submission
- "We'll fix it later" is impossible - submissions are final

**This workflow exists because:**
1. Human confidence without validation = optimism bias (proven by TDD research)
2. "Mostly correct" regulatory submissions = rejected submissions + penalties
3. Shortcuts under pressure = exactly when errors are most likely
4. Each gate prevents specific failure modes discovered in production

**The 3-gate architecture is not bureaucracy - it's risk management.**

Every section that seems "rigid" or "redundant" exists because someone, somewhere, cut that corner and caused a regulatory incident.

**Follow this workflow exactly. Your professional reputation depends on it.**

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**
- User requests mapping and creation of Brazilian regulatory templates
- BACEN CADOCs (4010, 4016, 4111), e-Financeira, DIMP, APIX
- Full automation from analysis to template creation

**Symptoms triggering this skill:**
- "Create CADOC 4010 template"
- "Map e-Financeira to Midaz and set up in Reporter"
- "Automate DIMP template creation"

**When NOT to use:**
- Non-Brazilian regulations
- Analysis-only without template creation
- Templates already exist and just need updates

## NO EXCEPTIONS - Read This First

**This workflow has ZERO exceptions.** Brazilian regulatory compliance (BACEN, RFB) has zero margin for error.

### Common Pressures You Must Resist

| Pressure | Your Thought | Reality |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Deadline** | "Skip Gate 2, we're confident" | Gate 1 analysis ≠ Gate 2 validation. Confidence without verification = optimism bias |
| **Authority** | "Manager says skip it" | Manager authority doesn't override regulatory requirements. Workflow protects both of you |
| **Fatigue** | "Manual creation is faster" | Fatigue makes errors MORE likely. Automation doesn't get tired |
| **Economic** | "Optional fields have no fines" | Template is reusable. Skipping fields = technical debt + future rework |
| **Sunk Cost** | "Reuse existing template" | 70% overlap = 30% different. Regulatory work doesn't tolerate "mostly correct" |
| **Pragmatism** | "Setup is ceremony" | Setup initializes context. Skipping = silent assumptions |
| **Efficiency** | "Fix critical only" | Gate 2 PASS criteria: ALL uncertainties resolved, not just critical |

### Emergency Scenarios

**"Production is down, need template NOW"**
→ Production issues don't override regulatory compliance. Fix production differently.

**"CEO directive to ship immediately"**
→ CEO authority doesn't override BACEN requirements. Escalate risk in writing.

**"Client contract requires delivery today"**
→ Contract penalties < regulatory penalties. Renegotiate delivery, don't skip validation.

**"Tool/agent is unavailable"**
→ Wait for tools or escalate. Manual workarounds bypass validation layers.

### The Bottom Line

**Shortcuts in regulatory templates = career-ending mistakes.**

BACEN and RFB submissions are final. You cannot "patch next sprint." Every gate exists because regulatory compliance has zero tolerance for "mostly correct."

**If you're tempted to skip ANY part of this workflow, stop and ask yourself: Am I willing to stake my professional reputation on this shortcut?**

## Rationalization Table - Know the Excuses

Every rationalization below has been used to justify skipping workflow steps. **ALL are invalid.**

| Excuse | Why It's Wrong | Correct Response |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| "Gate 2 is redundant when Gate 1 is complete" | Gate 1 = analysis, Gate 2 = validation. Different purposes. Validation catches analysis errors | Run Gate 2 completely |
| "Manual creation is pragmatic" | Manual bypasses validation layer. Gate 3 agent validates against Gate 2 report | Use automation agent |
| "Optional fields don't affect compliance" | Overall confidence includes all fields. Skipping 36% fails PASS criteria | Map all fields |
| "70% overlap means we can copy" | 30% difference contains critical regulatory fields. Similarity ≠ simplicity | Run full workflow |
| "Setup is bureaucratic ceremony" | Setup initializes context for Gates 1-3. Skipping creates silent assumptions | Run setup completely |
| "Fix critical issues only" | Gate 2 PASS: ALL uncertainties resolved. Medium/low issues cascade to mandatory failures | Resolve all uncertainties |
| "We're experienced, simplified workflow" | Experience doesn't exempt you from validation. Regulatory work requires process | Follow full workflow |
| "Following spirit not letter" | Regulatory compliance requires BOTH. Skipping steps violates spirit AND letter | Process IS the spirit |
| "Being pragmatic vs dogmatic" | Process exists because pragmatism failed. Brazilian regulatory penalties are severe | Rigor is pragmatism |
| "Tool is too rigid for real-world" | Rigidity prevents errors. Real-world includes regulatory audits and penalties | Rigidity is protection |

### If You Find Yourself Making These Excuses

**STOP. You are rationalizing.**

The workflow exists specifically to prevent these exact thoughts from leading to errors. If the workflow seems "too rigid," that's evidence it's working - preventing you from shortcuts that seem reasonable but create risk.

## Workflow Overview

**Flow:** Setup → Gate 1 → Gate 2 → Gate 3 → Template Created ✅

| Phase | Sub-skill | Purpose | Agent |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Setup | `regulatory-templates-setup` | Template selection, context init | — |
| Gate 1 | `regulatory-templates-gate1` | Regulatory analysis, field mapping | `finops-analyzer` (opus) |
| Gate 2 | `regulatory-templates-gate2` | Validate mappings, test transformations | `finops-analyzer` (opus) |
| Gate 3 | `regulatory-templates-gate3` | Generate .tpl template file | `finops-automation` (sonnet) |

---

## Orchestration Process

**Step 1:** Initialize TodoWrite with 5 tasks (setup, gate1, gate2, gate3, verify)

**Step 2-5:** Execute each sub-skill using Skill tool:

| Step | Skill | On PASS | On FAIL |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| 2 | `regulatory-templates-setup` | Store context → Gate 1 | Fix selection issues |
| 3 | `regulatory-templates-gate1` | Store spec report → Gate 2 | Address critical gaps, retry |
| 4 | `regulatory-templates-gate2` | Store finalized report → Gate 3 | Resolve uncertainties, retry |
| 5 | `regulatory-templates-gate3` | Template complete | 401=refresh token, 500/503=wait+retry |

**Context flows in memory** - no intermediate files created

---

## Context Management - Report-Driven Flow

**Context accumulates through gates (each adds, never overwrites):**

| After | Context Additions |
|-------|-------------------|
| Setup | `template_selected`, `template_code`, `authority`, `deadline` |
| Gate 1 | `specification_report` (template_info, fields, transformations, validations, structure) |
| Gate 2 | `finalized_report` (validated, uncertainties_resolved, all_fields_mapped, ready_for_implementation) |
| Gate 3 | `gate3` (template_file, filename, path, ready_for_use, report_compliance: 100%) |

---

## Template Specifications Management

- Gates load specs dynamically from centralized config
- Add new templates by adding specifications only (no new skills)
- Pattern: `loadTemplateSpecifications(templateName)` for field mappings, validation rules, format specs

---

## State Tracking

Output after EACH sub-skill: `SKILL: regulatory-templates | PHASE: {phase} | TEMPLATE: {template} | GATES: {n}/3 | CURRENT: {action} | NEXT: {next} | BLOCKERS: {blockers}`

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Gate failure (retriable) | Fix issues → retry gate |
| Gate failure (non-retriable) | Escalate to user |
| Gate 3: 401 | Refresh token → retry |
| Gate 3: 500/503 | Wait 2 min → retry |

---

## Coordination Rules

1. Sequential execution (1→2→3)
2. Context accumulates (never overwrites)
3. Failure stops progress
4. State tracking after each sub-skill
5. TodoWrite updates immediately
6. NO intermediate files (memory only)
7. SINGLE output file (.tpl in Gate 3)

---

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP and re-read the NO EXCEPTIONS section:

### Skip Patterns
- "Skip Gate X" (any variation)
- "Run Gates out of order"
- "Parallel gates for speed"
- "Simplified workflow for experienced teams"
- "Emergency override protocol"

### Manual Workarounds
- "Create template manually"
- "Copy existing template"
- "Manual validation is sufficient"
- "I'll verify it myself"

### Partial Compliance
- "Fix critical only"
- "Map mandatory fields only"
- "Skip setup, we already know"
- "Lower pass threshold"

### Justification Language
- "Being pragmatic"
- "Following spirit not letter"
- "Real-world flexibility"
- "Process over outcome"
- "Dogmatic adherence"
- "We're confident"
- "Manager approved"

### If You See These Red Flags

1. **Acknowledge the rationalization** ("I'm trying to skip Gate 2")
2. **Read the NO EXCEPTIONS section** (understand why it's required)
3. **Follow the workflow completely** (no modifications)
4. **Document the pressure** (for future skill improvement)

**The workflow is non-negotiable. Regulatory compliance doesn't have "reasonable exceptions."**
