# Quit Caffeine

Break free from caffeine dependency with science-backed tracking and personalized tapering plans.

## What it does

- **Caffeine Tracking**: Log daily intake across coffee, tea, energy drinks, chocolate, and supplements
- **Tapering Support**: Generate gradual reduction schedules based on current consumption and target date
- **Withdrawal Timeline**: Predict symptom intensity and duration with day-by-day expectations
- **Natural Energy**: Suggest alternative focus techniques, exercise timing, and sleep optimization
- **Progress Milestones**: Track mood, energy levels, sleep quality, and cognitive performance throughout quit journey

## Usage

### Start Quit or Taper
"Create a caffeine quit plan for me" or "I want to reduce caffeine by 50% over 2 weeks"
- Sets baseline consumption
- Generates personalized tapering schedule
- Establishes target date and milestone checkpoints

### Track Withdrawal
"Log my caffeine intake today" or "I have a headache and brain fog"
- Records daily consumption with timestamps
- Maps symptoms to withdrawal phases
- Provides symptom management strategies

### Check Progress
"How's my withdrawal going?" or "Am I on track?"
- Compares actual vs planned tapering progress
- Highlights energy level trends
- Shows days until estimated completion

### Energy Alternatives
"I need energy without caffeine" or "What can I do instead of coffee?"
- Suggests natural energy boosters: hydration, movement, nutrition, sunlight
- Recommends timing for exercise and meals
- Provides quick focus techniques for energy crashes

### Sleep Improvement
"I'm sleeping better" or "Track my sleep quality"
- Monitors sleep duration and quality improvements
- Correlates sleep gains with caffeine reduction
- Suggests bedtime routines to reinforce gains

## Withdrawal Timeline

**Days 1–3: Peak Symptoms**
- Headaches (most common), fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating
- Intensity peaks around 24–48 hours
- Worst period; manage expectations and use pain relief if needed

**Days 4–7: Gradual Improvement**
- Headaches begin to fade, energy slightly improving
- Brain fog persists but becomes manageable
- Mood stabilizes, sleep starting to deepen

**Week 2+: Normalized State**
- Most withdrawal symptoms resolved
- Energy levels stabilize at new baseline
- Sleep quality noticeably improved, focus returning
- Full adjustment typically 7–14 days depending on baseline intake

## Tips

1. **Taper gradually over 1–2 weeks** rather than quitting cold turkey—reduces peak withdrawal severity by 60–70%
2. **Stay hydrated and move your body**—water and light exercise reduce headache intensity and boost natural energy
3. **Sync your schedule**—quit during a less demanding work period if possible; easier to manage symptoms with lower stress
4. **Replace the ritual, not just the caffeine**—morning tea without caffeine, afternoon walk instead of coffee break
5. **All data stays local on your machine**—your caffeine logs, withdrawal tracking, and energy data never leave your device
