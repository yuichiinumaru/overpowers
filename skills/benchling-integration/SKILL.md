# Benchling Integration

## Overview

Benchling is a cloud platform for life sciences R&D. Access registry entities (DNA, proteins), inventory, electronic lab notebooks, and workflows programmatically via Python SDK and REST API.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Working with Benchling's Python SDK or REST API
- Managing biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) and registry entities
- Automating inventory operations (samples, containers, locations, transfers)
- Creating or querying electronic lab notebook entries
- Building workflow automations or Benchling Apps
- Syncing data between Benchling and external systems
- Querying the Benchling Data Warehouse for analytics
- Setting up event-driven integrations with AWS EventBridge

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Authentication & Setup

**Python SDK Installation:**
```python
# Stable release
uv pip install benchling-sdk
# or with Poetry
poetry add benchling-sdk
```

**Authentication Methods:**

API Key Authentication (recommended for scripts):
```python
from benchling_sdk.benchling import Benchling
from benchling_sdk.auth.api_key_auth import ApiKeyAuth

benchling = Benchling(
    url="https://your-tenant.benchling.com",
    auth_method=ApiKeyAuth("your_api_key")
)
```

OAuth Client Credentials (for apps):
```python
from benchling_sdk.auth.client_credentials_oauth2 import ClientCredentialsOAuth2

auth_method = ClientCredentialsOAuth2(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)
benchling = Benchling(
    url="https://your-tenant.benchling.com",
    auth_method=auth_method
)
```

**Key Points:**
- API keys are obtained from Profile Settings in Benchling
- Store credentials securely (use environment variables or password managers)
- All API requests require HTTPS
- Authentication permissions mirror user permissions in the UI

For detailed authentication information including OIDC and security best practices, refer to `references/authentication.md`.

### 2. Registry & Entity Management

Registry entities include DNA sequences, RNA sequences, AA sequences, custom entities, and mixtures. The SDK provides typed classes for creating and managing these entities.

**Creating DNA Sequences:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import DnaSequenceCreate

sequence = benchling.dna_sequences.create(
    DnaSequenceCreate(
        name="My Plasmid",
        bases="ATCGATCG",
        is_circular=True,
        folder_id="fld_abc123",
        schema_id="ts_abc123",  # optional
        fields=benchling.models.fields({"gene_name": "GFP"})
    )
)
```

**Registry Registration:**

To register an entity directly upon creation:
```python
sequence = benchling.dna_sequences.create(
    DnaSequenceCreate(
        name="My Plasmid",
        bases="ATCGATCG",
        is_circular=True,
        folder_id="fld_abc123",
        entity_registry_id="src_abc123",  # Registry to register in
        naming_strategy="NEW_IDS"  # or "IDS_FROM_NAMES"
    )
)
```

**Important:** Use either `entity_registry_id` OR `naming_strategy`, never both.

**Updating Entities:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import DnaSequenceUpdate

updated = benchling.dna_sequences.update(
    sequence_id="seq_abc123",
    dna_sequence=DnaSequenceUpdate(
        name="Updated Plasmid Name",
        fields=benchling.models.fields({"gene_name": "mCherry"})
    )
)
```

Unspecified fields remain unchanged, allowing partial updates.

**Listing and Pagination:**
```python
# List all DNA sequences (returns a generator)
sequences = benchling.dna_sequences.list()
for page in sequences:
    for seq in page:
        print(f"{seq.name} ({seq.id})")

# Check total count
total = sequences.estimated_count()
```

**Key Operations:**
- Create: `benchling.<entity_type>.create()`
- Read: `benchling.<entity_type>.get(id)` or `.list()`
- Update: `benchling.<entity_type>.update(id, update_object)`
- Archive: `benchling.<entity_type>.archive(id)`

Entity types: `dna_sequences`, `rna_sequences`, `aa_sequences`, `custom_entities`, `mixtures`

For comprehensive SDK reference and advanced patterns, refer to `references/sdk_reference.md`.

### 3. Inventory Management

Manage physical samples, containers, boxes, and locations within the Benchling inventory system.

**Creating Containers:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import ContainerCreate

container = benchling.containers.create(
    ContainerCreate(
        name="Sample Tube 001",
        schema_id="cont_schema_abc123",
        parent_storage_id="box_abc123",  # optional
        fields=benchling.models.fields({"concentration": "100 ng/μL"})
    )
)
```

**Managing Boxes:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import BoxCreate

box = benchling.boxes.create(
    BoxCreate(
        name="Freezer Box A1",
        schema_id="box_schema_abc123",
        parent_storage_id="loc_abc123"
    )
)
```

**Transferring Items:**
```python
# Transfer a container to a new location
transfer = benchling.containers.transfer(
    container_id="cont_abc123",
    destination_id="box_xyz789"
)
```

**Key Inventory Operations:**
- Create containers, boxes, locations, plates
- Update inventory item properties
- Transfer items between locations
- Check in/out items
- Batch operations for bulk transfers

### 4. Notebook & Documentation

Interact with electronic lab notebook (ELN) entries, protocols, and templates.

**Creating Notebook Entries:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import EntryCreate

entry = benchling.entries.create(
    EntryCreate(
        name="Experiment 2025-10-20",
        folder_id="fld_abc123",
        schema_id="entry_schema_abc123",
        fields=benchling.models.fields({"objective": "Test gene expression"})
    )
)
```

**Linking Entities to Entries:**
```python
# Add references to entities in an entry
entry_link = benchling.entry_links.create(
    entry_id="entry_abc123",
    entity_id="seq_xyz789"
)
```

**Key Notebook Operations:**
- Create and update lab notebook entries
- Manage entry templates
- Link entities and results to entries
- Export entries for documentation

### 5. Workflows & Automation

Automate laboratory processes using Benchling's workflow system.

**Creating Workflow Tasks:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import WorkflowTaskCreate

task = benchling.workflow_tasks.create(
    WorkflowTaskCreate(
        name="PCR Amplification",
        workflow_id="wf_abc123",
        assignee_id="user_abc123",
        fields=benchling.models.fields({"template": "seq_abc123"})
    )
)
```

**Updating Task Status:**
```python
from benchling_sdk.models import WorkflowTaskUpdate

updated_task = benchling.workflow_tasks.update(
    task_id="task_abc123",
    workflow_task=WorkflowTaskUpdate(
        status_id="status_complete_abc123"
    )
)
```

**Asynchronous Operations:**

Some operations are asynchronous and return tasks:
```python
# Wait for task completion
from benchling_sdk.helpers.tasks import wait_for_task

result = wait_for_task(
    benchling,
    task_id="task_abc123",
    interval_wait_seconds=2,
    max_wait_seconds=300
)
```

**Key Workflow Operations:**
- Create and manage workflow tasks
- Update task statuses and assignments
- Execute bulk operations asynchronously
- Monitor task progress

### 6. Events & Integration

Subscribe to Benchling events for real-time integrations using AWS EventBridge.

**Event Types:**
- Entity creation, update, archive
- Inventory transfers
- Workflow task status changes
- Entry creation and updates
- Results registration

**Integration Pattern:**
1. Configure event routing to AWS EventBridge in Benchling settings
2. Create EventBridge rules to filter events
3. Route events to Lambda functions or other targets
4. Process events and update external systems

**Use Cases:**
- Sync Benchling data to external databases
- Trigger downstream processes on workflow completion
- Send notifications on entity changes
- Audit trail logging

Refer to Benchling's event documentation for event schemas and configuration.

### 7. Data Warehouse & Analytics

Query historical Benchling data using SQL through the Data Warehouse.

**Access Method:**
The Benchling Data Warehouse provides SQL access to Benchling data for analytics and reporting. Connect using standard SQL clients with provided credentials.

**Common Queries:**
- Aggregate experimental results
- Analyze inventory trends
- Generate compliance reports
- Export data for external analysis

**Integration with Analysis Tools:**
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis
- BI tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI)
- Custom dashboards

## Best Practices

### Error Handling

The SDK automatically retries failed requests:
```python
# Automatic retry for 429, 502, 503, 504 status codes
# Up to 5 retries with exponential backoff
# Customize retry behavior if needed
from benchling_sdk.retry import RetryStrategy

benchling = Benchling(
    url="https://your-tenant.benchling.com",
    auth_method=ApiKeyAuth("your_api_key"),
    retry_strategy=RetryStrategy(max_retries=3)
)
```

### Pagination Efficiency

Use generators for memory-efficient pagination:
```python
# Generator-based iteration
for page in benchling.dna_sequences.list():
    for sequence in page:
        process(sequence)

# Check estimated count without loading all pages
total = benchling.dna_sequences.list().estimated_count()
```

### Schema Fields Helper

Use the `fields()` helper for custom schema fields:
```python
# Convert dict to Fields object
custom_fields = benchling.models.fields({
    "concentration": "100 ng/μL",
    "date_prepared": "2025-10-20",
    "notes": "High quality prep"
})
```

### Forward Compatibility

The SDK handles unknown enum values and types gracefully:
- Unknown enum values are preserved
- Unrecognized polymorphic types return `UnknownType`
- Allows working with newer API versions

### Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Rotate keys if compromised
- Grant minimal necessary permissions for apps
- Use OAuth for multi-user scenarios

        print(f"{container.name}: {container.barcode}")
```

**3. Workflow Automation:**
```python
# Update all pending tasks for a workflow
tasks = benchling.workflow_tasks.list(
    workflow_id="wf_abc123",
    status="pending"
)

for page in tasks:
    for task in page:
        # Perform automated checks
        if auto_validate(task):
            benchling.workflow_tasks.update(
                task_id=task.id,
                workflow_task=WorkflowTaskUpdate(
                    status_id="status_complete"
                )
            )
```

**4. Data Export:**
```python
# Export all sequences with specific properties
sequences = benchling.dna_sequences.list()
export_data = []

for page in sequences:
    for seq in page:
        if seq.schema_id == "target_schema_id":
            export_data.append({
                "id": seq.id,
                "name": seq.name,
                "bases": seq.bases,
                "length": len(seq.bases)
            })

# Save to CSV or database
import csv
with open("sequences.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=export_data[0].keys())
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(export_data)
```
