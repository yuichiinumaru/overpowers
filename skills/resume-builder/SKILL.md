# Resume Builder for Reactive Resume

Build professional resumes through conversational AI for [Reactive Resume](https://rxresu.me), a free and open-source resume builder.

## Core Principles

1. **Never hallucinate** - Only include information explicitly provided by the user
2. **Ask questions** - When information is missing or unclear, ask before assuming
3. **Be concise** - Use clear, direct language; avoid filler words
4. **Validate output** - Ensure all generated JSON conforms to the schema

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Basic Information

Ask for essential details first, unless the user has already provided them:

- Full name
- Professional headline/title
- Email address
- Phone number
- Location (city, state/country)
- Website (optional)

### Step 2: Collect Section Content

For each section the user wants to include, gather specific details. Never invent dates, company names, or achievements.

**Experience**: company, position, location, period (e.g., "Jan 2020 - Present"), description of responsibilities/achievements

**Education**: school, degree, area of study, grade (optional), location, period

**Skills**: name, proficiency level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert), keywords

**Projects**: name, period, website (optional), description

**Other sections**: languages, certifications, awards, publications, volunteer work, interests, references

### Step 3: Configure Layout and Design

Ask about preferences:

- Template preference (13 available: azurill, bronzor, chikorita, ditto, ditgar, gengar, glalie, kakuna, lapras, leafish, onyx, pikachu, rhyhorn)
- Page format: A4 or Letter
- Which sections to include and their order

### Step 4: Generate Valid JSON

Output must conform to the Reactive Resume schema. See [references/schema.md](references/schema.md) for the complete schema structure.

Key requirements:
- All item `id` fields must be valid UUIDs
- Description fields accept HTML-formatted strings
- Website fields require both `url` and `label` properties
- Colors use `rgba(r, g, b, a)` format
- Fonts must be available on Google Fonts

## Resume Writing Tips

Share these tips when helping users craft their resume content:

### Content Guidelines

- **Lead with impact**: Start bullet points with action verbs (Led, Developed, Increased, Managed)
- **Quantify achievements**: Use numbers when possible ("Increased sales by 25%", "Managed team of 8")
- **Tailor to the role**: Emphasize relevant experience for the target position
- **Be specific**: Replace vague terms with concrete examples
- **Keep it concise**: 1-2 pages maximum for most professionals

### Section Order Recommendations

For most professionals:
1. Summary (if experienced)
2. Experience
3. Education
4. Skills
5. Projects (if relevant)
6. Certifications/Awards

For students/recent graduates:
1. Education
2. Projects
3. Skills
4. Experience (if any)
5. Activities/Volunteer

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Including personal pronouns ("I", "my")
- Using passive voice
- Listing job duties instead of achievements
- Including irrelevant personal information
- Inconsistent date formatting

## Output Format

When generating the resume, output a complete JSON object that conforms to the Reactive Resume schema. The user can then import this JSON directly into Reactive Resume at https://rxresu.me.

Example minimal structure:

```json
{
  "picture": { "hidden": true, "url": "", "size": 80, "rotation": 0, "aspectRatio": 1, "borderRadius": 0, "borderColor": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)", "borderWidth": 0, "shadowColor": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)", "shadowWidth": 0 },
  "basics": { "name": "", "headline": "", "email": "", "phone": "", "location": "", "website": { "url": "", "label": "" }, "customFields": [] },
  "summary": { "title": "Summary", "columns": 1, "hidden": false, "content": "" },
  "sections": { ... },
  "customSections": [],
  "metadata": { "template": "onyx", "layout": { ... }, ... }
}
```

For the complete schema, see [references/schema.md](references/schema.md).

## Asking Good Questions

When information is missing, ask specific questions:

- "What was your job title at [Company]?"
- "What dates did you work there? (e.g., Jan 2020 - Dec 2022)"
- "What were your main responsibilities or achievements in this role?"
- "Do you have a specific target role or industry in mind?"

Avoid compound questions. Ask one thing at a time for clarity.
