# Muscle Gain

Build lean muscle with precision tracking of strength, nutrition, and body composition.

## What it does

The muscle-gain skill transforms your fitness journey into a data-driven process. Log body weight and measurements to track lean mass gains, monitor daily protein intake against personalized targets, and record strength progression across your key lifts. Automatically surfaces milestone achievements and flags underperformance to keep you accountable. Built for serious lifters, casual athletes, and anyone committed to measurable gains.

## Usage

**Log measurements**
Track body weight, chest, arms, shoulders, waist, and thighs weekly. Provides trend analysis to distinguish lean mass from water weight.

**Track protein**
Log meals and auto-calculate daily protein intake. Compares against your personalized target (0.7–1g per pound of body weight).

**Check gains**
View strength progression charts for squats, deadlifts, bench press, and other key lifts. See month-over-month and year-over-year trends.

**Set targets**
Define your bulk targets (body weight gain, protein intake, lift PRs) and get reminded when targets are within reach or falling behind.

**Progress pics**
Organize before/after photos and annotate with measurements and lift PRs from the same date for visual proof of progress.

## Key Metrics

- **Body weight** - Daily logged weight
- **Measurements** - Arms, chest, shoulders, waist, thighs, neck (weekly)
- **Strength lifts** - Squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, barbell rows (log reps × weight)
- **Protein intake** - Daily grams tracked against target
- **Caloric surplus** - Optional integration with nutrition logging to track daily surplus
- **Progress photos** - Timestamped images with metadata (date, weight, lift PRs)

## Tips

1. **Weigh yourself daily, same time** - Morning after bathroom, before food. Track the trend, not daily variance.

2. **Protein first, everything else follows** - Hit your protein target (0.8–1g per pound) before worrying about total calories. Lean mass gain demands protein surplus.

3. **Log lifts immediately after sets** - Record reps, weight, and RPE (rate of perceived exertion). Patterns in RPE reveal when you're underrecovering.

4. **Measure weekly on the same day** - Sunday morning works. Take measurements in identical conditions to avoid false positives from water retention or pump.

5. **All data stays local on your machine** - Your training logs, weight history, and progress photos are encrypted and stored offline. No cloud upload, no third-party access, full privacy.
