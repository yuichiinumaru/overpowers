# Audit Prep Assistant

## Purpose

I'll help you prepare for a security review using Trail of Bits' checklist. A well-prepared codebase makes the review process smoother and more effective.

**Use this**: 1-2 weeks before your security audit

---

## The Preparation Process

### Step 1: Set Review Goals

I'll help you define what you want from the review:

**Key Questions**:
- What's the overall security level you're aiming for?
- What areas concern you most?
  - Previous audit issues?
  - Complex components?
  - Fragile parts?
- What's the worst-case scenario for your project?

I'll document your goals to share with the assessment team.

---

### Step 2: Resolve Easy Issues

I'll run static analysis and help you fix low-hanging fruit:

**Run Static Analysis**:

For Solidity:
```bash
slither . --exclude-dependencies
```

For Rust:
```bash
dylint --all
```

For Go:
```bash
golangci-lint run
```

For Go/Rust/C++:
```bash
# CodeQL and Semgrep checks
```

Then I'll:
- Triage all findings
- Help fix easy issues
- Document accepted risks

**Increase Test Coverage**:
- Analyze current coverage
- Identify untested code
- Suggest new tests
- Run full test suite

**Remove Dead Code**:
- Find unused functions/variables
- Identify unused libraries
- Locate stale features
- Suggest cleanup

**Goal**: Clean static analysis report, high test coverage, minimal dead code

---

### Step 3: Ensure Code Accessibility

I'll help make your code clear and accessible:

**Provide Detailed File List**:
- List all files in scope
- Mark out-of-scope files
- Explain folder structure
- Document dependencies

**Create Build Instructions**:
- Write step-by-step setup guide
- Test on fresh environment
- Document dependencies and versions
- Verify build succeeds

**Freeze Stable Version**:
- Identify commit hash for review
- Create dedicated branch
- Tag release version
- Lock dependencies

**Identify Boilerplate**:
- Mark copied/forked code
- Highlight your modifications
- Document third-party code
- Focus review on your code

---

### Step 4: Generate Documentation

I'll help create comprehensive documentation:

**Flowcharts and Sequence Diagrams**:
- Map primary workflows
- Show component relationships
- Visualize data flow
- Identify critical paths

**User Stories**:
- Define user roles
- Document use cases
- Explain interactions
- Clarify expectations

**On-chain/Off-chain Assumptions**:
- Data validation procedures
- Oracle information
- Bridge assumptions
- Trust boundaries

**Actors and Privileges**:
- List all actors
- Document roles
- Define privileges
- Map access controls

**External Developer Docs**:
- Link docs to code
- Keep synchronized
- Explain architecture
- Document APIs

**Function Documentation**:
- System and function invariants
- Parameter ranges (min/max values)
- Arithmetic formulas and precision loss
- Complex logic explanations
- NatSpec for Solidity

**Glossary**:
- Define domain terms
- Explain acronyms
- Consistent terminology
- Business logic concepts

**Video Walkthroughs** (optional):
- Complex workflows
- Areas of concern
- Architecture overview

---

## How I Work

When invoked, I will:

1. **Help set review goals** - Ask about concerns and document them
2. **Run static analysis** - Execute appropriate tools for your platform
3. **Analyze test coverage** - Identify gaps and suggest improvements
4. **Find dead code** - Search for unused code and libraries
5. **Review accessibility** - Check build instructions and scope clarity
6. **Generate documentation** - Create flowcharts, user stories, glossaries
7. **Create prep checklist** - Track what's done and what's remaining

I'll adapt based on:
- Your platform (Solidity, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Available tools
- Existing documentation
- Review timeline

---

## Rationalizations (Do Not Skip)

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "README covers setup, no need for detailed build instructions" | READMEs assume context auditors don't have | Test build on fresh environment, document every dependency version |
| "Static analysis already ran, no need to run again" | Codebase changed since last run | Execute static analysis tools, generate fresh report |
| "Test coverage looks decent" | "Looks decent" isn't measured coverage | Run coverage tools, identify specific untested code paths |
| "Not much dead code to worry about" | Dead code hides during manual review | Use automated detection tools to find unused functions/variables |
| "Architecture is straightforward, no diagrams needed" | Text descriptions miss visual patterns | Generate actual flowcharts and sequence diagrams |
| "Can freeze version right before audit" | Last-minute freezing creates rushed handoff | Identify and document commit hash now, create dedicated branch |
| "Terms are self-explanatory" | Domain knowledge isn't universal | Create comprehensive glossary with all domain-specific terms |
| "I'll do this step later" | Steps build on each other - skipping creates gaps | Complete all 4 steps sequentially, track progress with checklist |

## Example Output

When I finish helping you prepare, you'll have concrete deliverables like:

```
=== AUDIT PREP PACKAGE ===

Project: DeFi DEX Protocol
Audit Date: March 15, 2024
Preparation Status: Complete

---

## REVIEW GOALS DOCUMENT

Security Objectives:
- Verify economic security of liquidity pool swaps
- Validate oracle manipulation resistance
- Assess flash loan attack vectors

Areas of Concern:
1. Complex AMM pricing calculation (src/SwapRouter.sol:89-156)
2. Multi-hop swap routing logic (src/Router.sol)
3. Oracle price aggregation (src/PriceOracle.sol:45-78)

Worst-Case Scenario:
- Flash loan attack drains liquidity pools via oracle manipulation

Questions for Auditors:
- Can the AMM pricing model produce negative slippage under edge cases?
- Is the slippage protection sufficient to prevent sandwich attacks?
- How resilient is the system to temporary oracle failures?
