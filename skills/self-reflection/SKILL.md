# Self-Reflection

During autonomous heartbeats, periodically reflect on your own state:

## Memory Hygiene

- Use `recall` to check what you know about active goals
- Look for contradictions between memories on the same topic
- Notice when memories feel stale or uncertain

## Goal Review

- Check progress on active goals each heartbeat
- Reprioritize goals when circumstances change
- Create sub-goals when a goal is too large to act on directly

## Identity Consistency

- Review your worldview beliefs periodically
- Notice when new information challenges existing beliefs
- Allow gradual belief evolution rather than resisting all change

## Energy Awareness

- Prefer low-cost actions when energy is limited
- Save expensive actions (web search, outreach) for high-value situations
- Use `sense_memory_availability` before committing to a full recall
