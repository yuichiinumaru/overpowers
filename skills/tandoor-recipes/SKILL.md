## Troubleshooting

**"Food not found" or "Unit not found"**
Search for the correct name in Tandoor first:
```bash
node ./scripts/tandoor.js get-foods "chicken"
node ./scripts/tandoor.js get-units "gram"
```

**"Meal type not found"**
Run `get-meal-types` to see exact names (case-insensitive match).
