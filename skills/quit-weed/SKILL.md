# Quit Weed

Stay clear-headed. Track your streak. Build the habit.

## What it does

**quit-weed** helps you take a tolerance break or permanently quit cannabis by:

- **Streak Tracking** - Maintain a persistent counter of days without use
- **Craving Tools** - Quick interventions when urges hit (breathing exercises, distraction techniques, motivation boosts)
- **Clarity Timeline** - See expected mental/physical improvements at key milestones
- **Goal Setting** - Define your target (7-day t-break, 30 days, or permanent quit)
- **Progress Tracking** - Daily check-ins to stay accountable

## Usage

### Start a Break
Ask clawd to initiate a new streak:
- "Start a tolerance break"
- "Begin weed quit journey"
- "Set a 30-day cannabis goal"

Clawd will record the start date and your goal duration.

### Handle Cravings
When urges strike, trigger immediate support:
- "I'm having a craving right now"
- "Help me get through this"
- "What should I do about this urge?"

Get grounding techniques, distraction suggestions, and motivation reminders.

### Track Progress
Check your streak anytime:
- "How many days have I been clean?"
- "Show my progress"
- "Streak status"

View your current count, milestones reached, and time until next target.

### Set Your Goal
Define what success looks like:
- "I want to quit for 2 weeks"
- "Set a 90-day goal"
- "Make this permanent"

Clawd stores your target and adjusts the clarity timeline accordingly.

### Benefits Check
Understand what's happening in your body/mind:
- "What benefits should I see by now?"
- "When does brain fog clear?"
- "Physical benefits timeline"

Get science-backed expectations for sleep, focus, mood, and cognition at each stage.

## Clarity Timeline

| Milestone | Mental/Physical Changes |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Day 1** | Initial urges peak. Sleep may be disrupted. Energy dips. Irritability common. |
| **Day 3** | Brain fog starts lifting slightly. Sleep patterns normalize. Appetite returns. |
| **1 Week** | Mental clarity noticeably sharper. Vivid dreams resume. Mood stabilizes. Anxiety reduces. |
| **2 Weeks** | Focus and concentration significantly improved. Energy rebounds. Sleep quality deepens. |
| **1 Month** | Memory and cognition baseline restored. Motivation increases. Lungs clear. Appetite normalized. |

## Tips

1. **Hydrate heavily** - Drink 2-3x normal water intake. Helps flush your system and reduces cravings.

2. **Move your body** - 20-30 min of exercise (walk, run, yoga) crushes urges and accelerates clarity.

3. **Track cravings, not just days** - Note *when* cravings hit (time, trigger, emotion) to identify patterns and avoid them.

4. **Find a replacement ritual** - If you smoked at specific times, replace with tea, journaling, or a walk. Habit beats willpower.

5. **All data stays local on your machine** - Your streak, goals, and craving logs never leave your device. Complete privacy, always.
