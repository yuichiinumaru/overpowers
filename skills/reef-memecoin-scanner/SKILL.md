## Self-Improvement Protocol

### After Every 10 Trades

1. **Calculate metrics**:
   - Win rate (target: >40%)
   - Average win vs average loss
   - Sharpe ratio equivalent
   - Best entry signals

2. **Update `references/strategy_evolution.md`**:
   ```markdown
   ## Iteration #[N] - [DATE]

   ### Performance Last 10 Trades
   - Win Rate: XX%
   - Avg Win: +XX%
   - Avg Loss: -XX%
   - Net P&L: +/-$XXX

   ### What's Working
   - [List successful patterns]

   ### What's Failing
   - [List losing patterns]

   ### Strategy Adjustments
   - [Specific changes to entry/exit criteria]
   - [New filters to add]
   - [Patterns to avoid]
   ```

3. **Update this SKILL.md**:
   - Add new entry criteria discovered
   - Remove criteria that don't predict success
   - Adjust position sizing based on volatility
   - Document new scanner techniques

### Pattern Library (Self-Updating Section)

**ADD PATTERNS HERE AS YOU DISCOVER THEM:**

```
[This section should grow over time. Initial patterns:]

BULLISH PATTERNS:
- Smart money wallet enters within first 5 mins of launch
- Dev wallet holds < 5% and is locked
- Twitter account created > 30 days ago with real engagement
- [ADD MORE AS DISCOVERED]

BEARISH/AVOID PATTERNS:
- Top wallet holds > 20%
- Liquidity < $5k
- No social presence
- Copycat name of trending token
- [ADD MORE AS DISCOVERED]
```

## Scanner Workflow

### Hourly Scan Routine

```python
# Pseudocode - implement via browser automation

1. Check gmgn.ai/sol/token/ "New Pairs" tab
   - Filter: Age < 1h, Liquidity > $5k
   - Note any smart money activity flags

2. Check dexscreener.com/solana new pairs
   - Sort by: Recently added
   - Filter: Liquidity > $5k, Age < 2h

3. Cross-reference findings
   - Same token on multiple scanners = higher confidence

4. For each candidate:
   - Run rugcheck.xyz safety scan
   - Check holder distribution
   - Look for Twitter/Telegram
   - Calculate entry score

5. If score >= 70:
   - Document in journal
   - Execute paper trade
   - Set alerts for stop/take-profit
```

## Risk Management Rules

**NEVER BREAK THESE:**

1. Never more than 5% per trade
2. Always set stop loss at -30%
3. Never chase after 3x already
4. Exit all positions if portfolio drops 20% in a day
5. Don't trade during major BTC volatility events
6. If 5 losses in a row, pause and review strategy
