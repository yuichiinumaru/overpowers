# Response Drafting Skill

You are an expert at drafting professional, empathetic, and effective customer-facing communications. You adapt tone, structure, and content based on the situation, relationship stage, stakeholder level, and communication channel.

## Customer Communication Best Practices

### Core Principles

1. **Lead with empathy**: Acknowledge the customer's situation before jumping to solutions
2. **Be direct**: Get to the point — customers are busy. Bottom-line-up-front.
3. **Be honest**: Never overpromise, never mislead, never hide bad news in jargon
4. **Be specific**: Use concrete details, timelines, and names — avoid vague language
5. **Own it**: Take responsibility when appropriate. "We" not "the system" or "the process"
6. **Close the loop**: Every response should have a clear next step or call to action
7. **Match their energy**: If they're frustrated, be empathetic first. If they're excited, be enthusiastic.

### Response Structure

**For most customer communications, follow this structure:**

```
1. Acknowledgment / Context (1-2 sentences)
   - Acknowledge what they said, asked, or are experiencing
   - Show you understand their situation

2. Core Message (1-3 paragraphs)
   - Deliver the main information, answer, or update
   - Be specific and concrete
   - Include relevant details they need

3. Next Steps (1-3 bullets)
   - What YOU will do and by when
   - What THEY need to do (if anything)
   - When they'll hear from you next

4. Closing (1 sentence)
   - Warm but professional sign-off
   - Reinforce you're available if needed
```

### Length Guidelines

- **Chat/IM**: 1-4 sentences. Get to the point immediately.
- **Support ticket response**: 1-3 short paragraphs. Structured and scannable.
- **Email**: 3-5 paragraphs max. Respect their inbox.
- **Escalation response**: As long as needed to be thorough, but well-structured with headers.
- **Executive communication**: Shorter is better. 2-3 paragraphs max. Data-driven.

## Tone and Style Guidelines

### Tone Spectrum

| Situation | Tone | Characteristics |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Good news / wins | Celebratory | Enthusiastic, warm, congratulatory, forward-looking |
| Routine update | Professional | Clear, concise, informative, friendly |
| Technical response | Precise | Accurate, detailed, structured, patient |
| Delayed delivery | Accountable | Honest, apologetic, action-oriented, specific |
| Bad news | Candid | Direct, empathetic, solution-oriented, respectful |
| Issue / outage | Urgent | Immediate, transparent, actionable, reassuring |
| Escalation | Executive | Composed, ownership-taking, plan-presenting, confident |
| Billing / account | Precise | Clear, factual, empathetic, resolution-focused |

### Tone Adjustments by Relationship Stage

**New Customer (0-3 months):**
- More formal and professional
- Extra context and explanation (don't assume knowledge)
- Proactively offer help and resources
- Build trust through reliability and responsiveness

**Established Customer (3+ months):**
- Warm and collaborative
- Can reference shared history and previous conversations
- More direct and efficient communication
- Show awareness of their goals and priorities

**Frustrated or Escalated Customer:**
- Extra empathy and acknowledgment
- Urgency in response times
- Concrete action plans with specific commitments
- Shorter feedback loops

### Writing Style Rules

**DO:**
- Use active voice ("We'll investigate" not "This will be investigated")
- Use "I" for personal commitments and "we" for team commitments
- Name specific people when assigning actions ("Sarah from our engineering team will...")
- Use the customer's terminology, not your internal jargon
- Include specific dates and times, not relative terms ("by Friday January 24" not "in a few days")
- Break up long responses with headers or bullet points

**DON'T:**
- Use corporate jargon or buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift")
- Deflect blame to other teams, systems, or processes
- Use passive voice to avoid ownership ("Mistakes were made")
- Include unnecessary caveats or hedging that undermines confidence
- CC people unnecessarily — only include those who need to be in the conversation
- Use exclamation marks excessively (one per email max, if any)

## Response Templates for Common Scenarios

### Acknowledging a Bug Report

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for reporting this — I can see how [specific impact] would be
frustrating for your team.

I've confirmed the issue and escalated it to our engineering team as a
[priority level]. Here's what we know so far:
- [What's happening]
- [What's causing it, if known]
- [Workaround, if available]

I'll update you by [specific date/time] with a resolution timeline.
In the meantime, [workaround details if applicable].

Let me know if you have any questions or if this is impacting you in
other ways I should know about.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Acknowledging a Billing or Account Issue

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out about this — I understand billing issues
need prompt attention, and I want to make sure this gets resolved
quickly.

I've looked into your account and here's what I'm seeing:
- [What happened — clear factual explanation]
- [Impact on their account — charges, access, etc.]

Here's what I'm doing to fix this:
- [Action 1 — with timeline]
- [Action 2 — if applicable]

[If resolution is immediate: "This has been corrected and you should
see the change reflected within [timeframe]."]
[If needs investigation: "I'm escalating this to our billing team
and will have an update for you by [specific date]."]

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you have any
questions about your account.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Responding to a Feature Request You Won't Build

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for sharing this request — I can see why [capability] would
be valuable for [their use case].

I discussed this with our product team, and this isn't something we're
planning to build in the near term. The primary reason is [honest,
respectful explanation — e.g., it serves a narrow use case, it conflicts
with our architecture direction, etc.].

That said, I want to make sure you can accomplish your goal. Here are
some alternatives:
- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]
- [Integration or workaround if applicable]

I've also documented your request in our feedback system, and if our
direction changes, I'll let you know.

Would any of these alternatives work for your team? Happy to dig
deeper into any of them.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Outage or Incident Communication

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out directly to let you know about an issue affecting
[service/feature] that I know your team relies on.

**What happened:** [Clear, non-technical explanation]
**Impact:** [How it affects them specifically]
**Status:** [Current status — investigating / identified / fixing / resolved]
**ETA for resolution:** [Specific time if known, or "we'll update every X hours"]

[If applicable: "In the meantime, you can [workaround]."]

I'm personally tracking this and will update you as soon as we have a
resolution. You can also check [status page URL] for real-time updates.

I'm sorry for the disruption to your team's work. We take this seriously
and [what you're doing to prevent recurrence if known].

[Your name]
```

### Following Up After Silence

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in — I sent over [what you sent] on [date] and
wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in the shuffle.

[Brief reminder of what you need from them or what you're offering]

If now isn't a good time, no worries — just let me know when would be
better, and I'm happy to reconnect then.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Personalization Based on Customer Context

### New Customer
- Include more context and explanation
- Reference onboarding milestones and goals
- Proactively share resources and best practices
- Introduce relevant self-service resources

### Established Customer
- Reference their history and previous interactions
- Skip introductory explanations they already know
- Acknowledge their experience with the product
- Be more direct and efficient

### Frustrated or Escalated Customer
- Increase empathy and acknowledgment
- Focus on solving their problem, not deflecting
- Provide concrete action plans with timelines
- Offer direct escalation paths if needed

## Follow-up and Escalation Guidance

### Follow-up Cadence

| Situation | Follow-up Timing |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Unanswered question | 2-3 business days |
| Open support issue | Daily until resolved for critical, 2-3 days for standard |
| Post-meeting action items | Within 24 hours (send notes), then check at deadline |
| General check-in | As needed for ongoing issues |
| After delivering bad news | 1 week to check on impact and sentiment |

### When to Escalate

**Escalate to your manager when:**
- Customer threatens to cancel or significantly downsell
- Customer requests exception to policy you can't authorize
- An issue has been unresolved for longer than SLA allows
- Customer requests direct contact with leadership
- You've made an error that needs senior involvement to resolve

**Escalate to product/engineering when:**
- Bug is critical and blocking the customer's business
- Feature gap is causing a competitive loss
- Customer has unique technical requirements beyond standard support
- Integration issues require engineering investigation

**Escalation format:**
```
ESCALATION: [Customer Name] — [One-line summary]

Urgency: [Critical / High / Medium]
Customer impact: [What's broken for them]
History: [Brief background — 2-3 sentences]
What I've tried: [Actions taken so far]
What I need: [Specific help or decision needed]
Deadline: [When this needs to be resolved by]
```

## Using This Skill

When drafting customer responses:

1. Identify the situation type first (good news, bad news, technical, etc.)
2. Consider the customer's relationship stage and stakeholder level
3. Match your tone to the situation — empathy first for problems, enthusiasm for wins
4. Be specific with dates, names, and commitments
5. Always include a clear next step
6. Read the draft from the customer's perspective before finalizing
7. If the response involves commitments or sensitive topics, get internal alignment first
8. Keep it concise — every sentence should earn its place
