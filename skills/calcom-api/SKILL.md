# Cal.com API v2

This skill provides guidance for AI agents to interact with the Cal.com API v2, enabling scheduling automation, booking management, and calendar integrations.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.cal.com/v2
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer cal_<your_api_key>
```

For detailed authentication methods including OAuth/Platform authentication, see `references/authentication.md`.

## Core Concepts

**Event Types** define bookable meeting configurations (duration, location, availability rules). Each event type has a unique slug used in booking URLs.

**Bookings** are confirmed appointments created when someone books an event type. Each booking has a unique UID for identification.

**Schedules** define when a user is available for bookings. Users can have multiple schedules with different working hours.

**Slots** represent available time windows that can be booked based on event type configuration and user availability.

## Reference Documentation

This skill includes detailed API reference documentation for each domain:

| Reference | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `references/authentication.md` | API key and OAuth authentication, rate limiting, security best practices |
| `references/bookings.md` | Create, list, cancel, reschedule bookings |
| `references/event-types.md` | Configure bookable meeting types |
| `references/schedules.md` | Manage user availability schedules |
| `references/slots-availability.md` | Query available time slots |
| `references/calendars.md` | Calendar connections and busy times |
| `references/webhooks.md` | Real-time event notifications |

## Quick Start

### 1. Check Available Slots

Before creating a booking, check available time slots:

```http
GET /v2/slots?startTime=2024-01-15T00:00:00Z&endTime=2024-01-22T00:00:00Z&eventTypeId=123
```

See `references/slots-availability.md` for full details.

### 2. Create a Booking

```http
POST /v2/bookings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "start": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "eventTypeId": 123,
  "attendee": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "timeZone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

See `references/bookings.md` for all booking operations.

### 3. Set Up Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications for booking events:

```http
POST /v2/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subscriberUrl": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "triggers": ["BOOKING_CREATED", "BOOKING_CANCELLED"]
}
```

See `references/webhooks.md` for available triggers and payload formats.

## Common Workflows

**Book a meeting**: Check slots -> Create booking -> Store booking UID

**Reschedule**: Get new slots -> POST /v2/bookings/{uid}/reschedule

**Cancel**: POST /v2/bookings/{uid}/cancel with optional reason

## Best Practices

1. Always check slot availability before creating bookings
2. Store booking UIDs for future operations (cancel, reschedule)
3. Use ISO 8601 format for all timestamps
4. Implement webhook handlers for real-time updates
5. Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
