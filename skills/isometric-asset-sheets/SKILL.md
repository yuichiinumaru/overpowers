# Isometric Asset Sheet Generation

Generate consistent sprite sheets for the isometric city game using the GenerateImage tool.

## Standard Format

All asset sheets follow this format:
- **Size**: Square, max width and height
- **Background**: Solid red (#FF0000), no variation in red tone
- **Grid**: 6 rows x 5 columns (30 cells total)
- **Style**: Hyper-realistic
- **Lighting**: No shadows

## Grid Layout

Each row represents ONE complete asset (vehicle, building, etc.):

| Column | View |
|--------|------|
| 1 | Isometric facing **North West** |
| 2 | Isometric facing **North East** |
| 3 | Isometric facing **South East** |
| 4 | Isometric facing **South West** |
| 5 | Special view (varies by asset type) |

### Special Views by Asset Type

| Asset Type | Column 5 View |
|------------|---------------|
| Airplanes | Gears down, head-first isometric (landing approach) |
| Helicopters | Top-down rotor view |
| Vehicles/Cars | 3/4 front isometric |
| Boats | Docked/stationary view |
| Trains | Front cab view |

## Prompt Template

```
Using the same format as [reference if available] - red background, 6 rows, 5 columns - I need you to make a new asset sheet with [ASSET TYPE] for my isometric city game.

Each row should be ONE [ASSET]. The first 4 items should be the [ASSET] isometrically projected 4 times for flying/facing north west, north east, south east, and then south west. The last one should be [SPECIAL VIEW DESCRIPTION].

ALL [ASSETS] SHOULD BE HYPER REALISTIC. [CATEGORY DESCRIPTIONS BY ROW].

NO SHADOWS. [ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS]. Full size, 2048x2048 square.
```

## Example Prompts

### Airplanes

```
Using the same format as this image - red background, 6 rows, 5 columns - I need you to make a new asset sheet with AIRPLANES for my isometric city game.

Each row should be ONE PLANE. The first 4 items should be the airplane isometrically projected 4 times for flying north west, north east, south east, and then south west. The last one should be a gears down head-first isometric view.

ALL PLANES SHOULD BE HYPER REALISTIC. Commercial or private jets. First 3 rows commercial airliners.

NO SHADOWS. For the first 4, NO LANDING GEAR. Full size, 2048x2048 square.
```

### Ground Vehicles

```
Red background, 6 rows, 5 columns - asset sheet with VEHICLES for my isometric city game.

Each row should be ONE VEHICLE. The first 4 items should be the vehicle isometrically projected facing north west, north east, south east, and then south west. The last one should be a 3/4 front isometric view.

ALL VEHICLES SHOULD BE HYPER REALISTIC. Row 1-2: sedans. Row 3-4: SUVs. Row 5-6: trucks.

NO SHADOWS. Full size, 2048x2048 square.
```

### Boats/Ships

```
Red background, 6 rows, 5 columns - asset sheet with BOATS for my isometric city game.

Each row should be ONE BOAT. The first 4 items should be the boat isometrically projected facing north west, north east, south east, and then south west. The last one should be a docked/stationary overhead isometric view.

ALL BOATS SHOULD BE HYPER REALISTIC. Row 1-3: small boats (fishing, sailboat, speedboat). Row 4-6: larger vessels.

NO SHADOWS. NO WATER/WAKE. Full size, 2048x2048 square.
```

## Asset Constraints

| Asset Type | Constraints |
|------------|-------------|
| Airplanes | No landing gear (flying views), no contrails |
| Helicopters | Rotors visible, no motion blur |
| Vehicles | Wheels visible, no reflections |
| Boats | No water, no wake effects |
| Buildings | Consistent lighting angle |

## Row Organization

Organize rows by category/size:

- **Vehicles**: Small to large, or by type (sedans, SUVs, trucks)
- **Airplanes**: Commercial (rows 1-3), private (rows 4-6)
- **Buildings**: Similar style/era per row
- **Nature**: Trees grouped by season or type

## After Generation

Once the asset sheet is generated:
1. Save to `/public/assets/` with descriptive name
2. Follow the [adding-asset-sheets guide](../../../skills/adding-asset-sheets.md) to integrate
3. Configure in `renderConfig.ts` with correct row/column mappings

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Inconsistent sizing | Specify "same size for all assets" |
| Shadows appearing | Explicitly state "NO SHADOWS" |
| Wrong projections | Reference compass directions (NW, NE, SE, SW) |
| Cut-off assets | Add "centered in each cell" to prompt |
