# Strategic Narrative

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Writing product pitches
- Creating presentations
- Framing features as stories
- Building product narratives

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Strategic Narrative Structure (Source: Andy Raskin)

**Five-Act Structure:**

1. **Old World** - How things used to be
2. **Insight** - What changed (why now?)
3. **New World** - What's now possible
4. **Stakes** - Win big or lose
5. **Your Role** - How you help them win

**Example:**
```markdown
# Pitch: [Product]

## Act 1: Old World
"For years, teams coordinated through email..."

## Act 2: Insight
"But remote work changed everything. What worked in office doesn't work distributed."

## Act 3: New World
"Now, the best teams coordinate in real-time, asynchronously..."

## Act 4: Stakes
"Companies that figure this out will attract best talent and move faster. Those that don't will lose to competitors."

## Act 5: Your Role
"That's where [Product] comes in. We help teams..."
```

## The Stakes (Urgency)
[Win big or lose - why this matters]

## Our Solution (Product)
[How we help you win in the new world]

## Proof
