# NeuroKit2

## Overview

NeuroKit2 is a comprehensive Python toolkit for processing and analyzing physiological signals (biosignals). Use this skill to process cardiovascular, neural, autonomic, respiratory, and muscular signals for psychophysiology research, clinical applications, and human-computer interaction studies.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when working with:
- **Cardiac signals**: ECG, PPG, heart rate variability (HRV), pulse analysis
- **Brain signals**: EEG frequency bands, microstates, complexity, source localization
- **Autonomic signals**: Electrodermal activity (EDA/GSR), skin conductance responses (SCR)
- **Respiratory signals**: Breathing rate, respiratory variability (RRV), volume per time
- **Muscular signals**: EMG amplitude, muscle activation detection
- **Eye tracking**: EOG, blink detection and analysis
- **Multi-modal integration**: Processing multiple physiological signals simultaneously
- **Complexity analysis**: Entropy measures, fractal dimensions, nonlinear dynamics

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Cardiac Signal Processing (ECG/PPG)

Process electrocardiogram and photoplethysmography signals for cardiovascular analysis. See `references/ecg_cardiac.md` for detailed workflows.

**Primary workflows:**
- ECG processing pipeline: cleaning → R-peak detection → delineation → quality assessment
- HRV analysis across time, frequency, and nonlinear domains
- PPG pulse analysis and quality assessment
- ECG-derived respiration extraction

**Key functions:**
```python
import neurokit2 as nk

# Complete ECG processing pipeline
signals, info = nk.ecg_process(ecg_signal, sampling_rate=1000)

# Analyze ECG data (event-related or interval-related)
analysis = nk.ecg_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=1000)

# Comprehensive HRV analysis
hrv = nk.hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=1000)  # Time, frequency, nonlinear domains
```

### 2. Heart Rate Variability Analysis

Compute comprehensive HRV metrics from cardiac signals. See `references/hrv.md` for all indices and domain-specific analysis.

**Supported domains:**
- **Time domain**: SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, SDSD, and derived metrics
- **Frequency domain**: ULF, VLF, LF, HF, VHF power and ratios
- **Nonlinear domain**: Poincaré plot (SD1/SD2), entropy measures, fractal dimensions
- **Specialized**: Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), recurrence quantification analysis (RQA)

**Key functions:**
```python
# All HRV indices at once
hrv_indices = nk.hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=1000)

# Domain-specific analysis
hrv_time = nk.hrv_time(peaks)
hrv_freq = nk.hrv_frequency(peaks, sampling_rate=1000)
hrv_nonlinear = nk.hrv_nonlinear(peaks, sampling_rate=1000)
hrv_rsa = nk.hrv_rsa(peaks, rsp_signal, sampling_rate=1000)
```

# Average across epochs
grand_average = nk.epochs_average(epochs)
```

### 11. Multi-Signal Integration

Process multiple physiological signals simultaneously with unified output. See `references/bio_module.md` for integration workflows.

**Key functions:**
```python
# Process multiple signals at once
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg_signal,
    rsp=rsp_signal,
    eda=eda_signal,
    emg=emg_signal,
    sampling_rate=1000
)

# Analyze all processed signals
bio_analysis = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)
```

## Analysis Modes

NeuroKit2 automatically selects between two analysis modes based on data duration:

**Event-related analysis** (< 10 seconds):
- Analyzes stimulus-locked responses
- Epoch-based segmentation
- Suitable for experimental paradigms with discrete trials

**Interval-related analysis** (≥ 10 seconds):
- Characterizes physiological patterns over extended periods
- Resting state or continuous activities
- Suitable for baseline measurements and long-term monitoring

Most `*_analyze()` functions automatically choose the appropriate mode.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install neurokit2
```

For development version:
```bash
uv pip install https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/zipball/dev

## Common Workflows

hrv = nk.hrv(info['ECG_R_Peaks'], sampling_rate=1000)

# Visualize

```

### Multi-Modal Analysis
```python
