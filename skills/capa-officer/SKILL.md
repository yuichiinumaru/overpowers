```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Methodologies
Apply systematic root cause analysis techniques ensuring thorough problem investigation and sustainable solutions.

**RCA Method Selection:**
1. **5 Why Analysis** - For straightforward process issues
2. **Fishbone Diagram** - For complex multi-factor problems
3. **Fault Tree Analysis** - For safety-critical system failures
4. **Human Factors Analysis** - For procedure or training-related issues
5. **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)** - For systematic risk assessment

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. **Problem Definition and Scoping**
   - Clear problem statement development
   - Impact assessment and scope definition
   - Investigation team establishment
   - **Decision Point**: Select appropriate RCA methodology

2. **Data Collection and Analysis**
   - **For Quality Issues**: Follow references/quality-investigation-guide.md
   - **For Safety Issues**: Follow references/safety-investigation-guide.md
   - **For Process Issues**: Follow references/process-investigation-guide.md
   - Evidence gathering and documentation

3. **Root Cause Identification**
   - Multi-level cause analysis (immediate, contributing, root)
   - Human factors and system factors evaluation
   - Verification of root cause validity
   - Risk assessment integration

### 3. Corrective Action Planning and Implementation
Develop and oversee implementation of effective corrective actions addressing identified root causes.

**Corrective Action Development:**
- **Immediate Actions**: Contain the problem and prevent recurrence
- **Corrective Actions**: Address root causes systematically
- **Verification Actions**: Ensure effectiveness and sustainability
- **Preventive Actions**: Prevent similar issues in other areas

**Action Plan Components:**
- Specific, measurable actions with clear deliverables
- Responsible person assignment and accountability
- Resource requirements and availability
- Timeline with key milestones and dependencies
- Success criteria and measurement methods

### 4. Preventive Action Implementation
Proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact quality or patient safety.

**Preventive Action Sources:**
- Trend analysis of quality data
- Risk assessment outcomes
- Industry best practices and lessons learned
- Regulatory guidance and warning letters
- Internal audit findings and observations

**Preventive Action Workflow:**
1. **Potential Issue Identification**
2. **Risk Assessment and Prioritization**
3. **Preventive Action Planning**
4. **Implementation and Monitoring**
5. **Effectiveness Verification**

## CAPA System Optimization

### CAPA Performance Metrics
Monitor key performance indicators ensuring CAPA system effectiveness and continuous improvement.

**Key CAPA Metrics:**
- **CAPA Cycle Time**: Average time from initiation to closure
- **First-Time Effectiveness**: Percentage of CAPAs effective on first implementation
- **Recurrence Rate**: Percentage of issues that recur after CAPA closure
- **Overdue CAPA Rate**: Percentage of CAPAs exceeding planned timelines
- **Investigation Quality**: Thoroughness and accuracy of root cause analysis

### Trend Analysis and Reporting
Conduct systematic trend analysis identifying patterns and opportunities for systemic improvement.

**Trend Analysis Framework:**
1. **Data Aggregation and Categorization**
   - CAPA source categorization (complaints, audits, nonconformances)
   - Product line and process area analysis
   - Time-based trending and seasonal patterns
   - Severity and impact assessment

2. **Pattern Identification**
   - Statistical analysis and correlation identification
   - Root cause pattern recognition
   - System-level issue identification
   - Preventive action opportunity assessment

3. **Management Reporting**
   - **Monthly CAPA Status Reports** for operational management
   - **Quarterly Trend Analysis Reports** for senior leadership
   - **Annual CAPA Effectiveness Reviews** for strategic planning
   - Ad-hoc escalation reports for critical issues

## Cross-functional Integration

### Risk Management Integration
Ensure seamless integration between CAPA processes and risk management activities.

**CAPA-Risk Interface:**
- Risk assessment updating based on CAPA findings
- Risk control effectiveness verification through CAPA
- Residual risk evaluation and acceptance
- Risk management file maintenance and updates

### Quality System Interface
Coordinate CAPA activities with broader quality system processes ensuring systematic improvement.

**Quality System Touchpoints:**
- **Management Review**: CAPA effectiveness reporting and trends
- **Internal Audit**: CAPA-generated audit findings and follow-up
- **Document Control**: Procedure and work instruction updates
- **Training**: Competency requirements and training effectiveness
- **Supplier Quality**: Supplier CAPA coordination and monitoring

### Regulatory Compliance
