# Contract Template Skill

## Overview

This skill enables creation of smart contract templates using **Accord Project** - an open-source framework for legally enforceable, machine-readable contracts. Create templates with embedded logic that can automate contract execution.

## How to Use

1. Describe the contract type and terms
2. Specify variables and logic rules
3. I'll generate Accord Project template

**Example prompts:**
- "Create an NDA template with variable terms"
- "Build a service agreement with payment milestones"
- "Generate a rental agreement template"
- "Design a consulting contract with termination clauses"

## Domain Knowledge

### Template Structure

```
contract-template/
├── package.json           # Metadata
├── grammar/
│   └── template.tem.md    # Natural language template
├── model/
│   └── model.cto          # Data model
├── logic/
│   └── logic.ergo         # Business logic
└── text/
    └── sample.md          # Sample contract
```

### Template Syntax (TemplateMark)

```markdown
# Service Agreement

This Agreement is made between [{supplier}] ("Supplier")
and [{buyer}] ("Buyer").

## Services
The Supplier agrees to provide [{serviceDescription}].

## Payment
The Buyer shall pay [{paymentAmount}] within
[{paymentDays}] days of invoice.

## Term
This Agreement begins on [{startDate as "MMMM DD, YYYY"}]
and continues for [{termMonths}] months.

{{#if latePenalty}}
## Late Payment
A penalty of [{penaltyPercent}]% applies to late payments.
{{/if}}
```

### Data Model (Concerto)

```cto
namespace org.example.service

import org.accordproject.time.*

asset ServiceAgreement extends Contract {
  o String supplier
  o String buyer
  o String serviceDescription
  o Double paymentAmount
  o Integer paymentDays
  o DateTime startDate
  o Integer termMonths
  o Boolean latePenalty optional
  o Double penaltyPercent optional
}

transaction PaymentRequest {
  o Double amount
  o DateTime dueDate
}

transaction PaymentResponse {
  o Double amount
  o Double penalty
  o DateTime paymentDue
}
```

### Business Logic (Ergo)

```ergo
namespace org.example.service

import org.accordproject.time.*

contract ServiceContract over ServiceAgreement {

  clause payment(request : PaymentRequest) : PaymentResponse {
    let dueDate = addDuration(request.dueDate,
                              Duration{ amount: contract.paymentDays, unit: ~org.accordproject.time.TemporalUnit.days });

    let penalty =
      if contract.latePenalty
      then request.amount * contract.penaltyPercent / 100.0
      else 0.0;

    return PaymentResponse{
      amount: request.amount,
      penalty: penalty,
      paymentDue: dueDate
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Cicero CLI

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @accordproject/cicero-cli

# Parse contract
cicero parse --template ./contract-template --sample ./text/sample.md

# Execute logic
cicero trigger --template ./contract-template \
  --sample ./text/sample.md \
  --request ./request.json

# Draft new contract
cicero draft --template ./contract-template --data ./data.json
```

## Example: NDA Template

### template.tem.md
```markdown
# Non-Disclosure Agreement

This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into
as of [{effectiveDate as "MMMM DD, YYYY"}] by and between:

**Disclosing Party:** [{disclosingParty}]
**Receiving Party:** [{receivingParty}]

## 1. Confidential Information

"Confidential Information" means all non-public information
disclosed by the Disclosing Party, including but not limited to:
[{confidentialScope}].

## 2. Obligations

The Receiving Party agrees to:
- Maintain confidentiality for [{termYears}] years
- Use information only for [{permittedPurpose}]

{{#if hasExclusions}}
[{exclusions}]
{{else}}
- Is or becomes publicly available
- Was known prior to disclosure
- Is independently developed
{{/if}}

## 4. Return of Materials

Upon termination, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy
all Confidential Information within [{returnDays}] days.

## 5. Remedies

{{#if monetaryPenalty}}
