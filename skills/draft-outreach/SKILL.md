# Draft Outreach

Research first, then draft. This skill never sends generic outreach - it always researches the prospect first to personalize the message. Works standalone with web search, supercharged when you connect your tools.

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Enrichment** | Verified email, phone, background details |
| **CRM** | Prior relationship context, existing contacts |
| **Email** | Create draft directly in your inbox |

> **No connectors?** Web research works great. I'll output the email text for you to copy.

## How It Works

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                      DRAFT OUTREACH                               |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 1: RESEARCH (always happens first)                         |
|  - Web search (default)                                           |
|  - + Enrichment (if enrichment tools connected)                  |
|  - + CRM (if CRM connected)                                      |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 2: DRAFT (based on research)                               |
|  - Personalized opening (from research)                          |
|  - Relevant hook (their priorities)                              |
|  - Clear CTA                                                      |
|                                                                   |
|  Step 3: DELIVER (based on connectors)                           |
|  - Email draft (if email connected)                              |
|  - Copy for LinkedIn (always)                                    |
|  - Output to user (always)                                        |

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Parse Request

```
Input patterns:
- "draft outreach to John Smith at Acme" → Person + company
- "write cold email to Acme's CTO" → Role + company
- "reach out to sarah@acme.com" → Email provided
- "LinkedIn message to [LinkedIn URL]" → Profile provided
```

### Step 2: Research First (Always)

**Use research-prospect skill internally:**
```
1. Web search for company + person
2. If Enrichment connected: Get verified contact info, background
3. If CRM connected: Check for prior relationship
```

**Must find before drafting:**
- Who they are (title, background)
- What the company does
- Recent news or trigger
- Personalization hook

### Step 3: Identify Hook

```
Priority order for hooks:
1. Trigger event (funding, hiring, news) → Most timely
2. Mutual connection → Social proof
3. Their content (post, article, talk) → Shows you did research
4. Company initiative → Relevant to their priorities
5. Role-based pain point → Least personal but still relevant
```

### Step 4: Draft Message

**Email Structure (AIDA):**
```
SUBJECT: [Personalized, <50 chars, no spam words]

[Opening: Personal hook - shows you researched them]

[Interest: Their problem/opportunity in 1-2 sentences]

[Desire: Brief proof point - similar company result]

[Action: Clear, low-friction CTA]

[Signature]
```

**LinkedIn Connection Request (<300 chars):**
```
Hi [Name], [Mutual connection/shared interest/genuine compliment].
Would love to connect. [No pitch]
```

**LinkedIn Follow-up Message:**
```
Thanks for connecting! [Value-first: insight, article, observation]

[Soft transition to why you reached out]

[Question, not pitch]
```

### Step 5: Create Email Draft

```
If email connector available:
1. Create draft with to, subject, body
2. Return draft link
3. Note: "Draft created - review and send"

If not available:
1. Output email text
2. Note: "Copy to your email client"
```

| Capability | Web Only | + Enrichment | + CRM | + Email |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------|---------|
| Personalized opening | Basic | Deep | With history | Same |
| Verified email | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Background details | Public only | Full | Full | Full |
| Prior relationship | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Auto-create draft | No | No | No | Yes |

## Message Templates by Scenario

### Cold Outreach (No Prior Relationship)

```
Subject: [Their initiative] + [your angle]

Hi [Name],

[Personal hook based on research - news, content, mutual connection].

[1 sentence on their likely challenge based on role/company].

[Brief proof: "We helped [Similar Company] achieve [Result]".]

Worth a 15-min call to see if relevant?

[Signature]
```

### Warm Outreach (Have Met / Mutual Connection)

```
Subject: Following up from [context]

Hi [Name],

[Reference to how you know them / who connected you].

[Why reaching out now - their trigger].

[Specific value you can offer].

[CTA]
```

### Re-Engagement (Went Dark)

```
Subject: [Short, curiosity-driven]

Hi [Name],

[Acknowledge time passed without being guilt-trippy].

[New reason to reconnect - their news or your news].

[Simple question to re-open dialogue].

[Signature]
```

### Post-Event Follow-up

```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Event]

Hi [Name],

[Specific memory from conversation].

[Value-add: article, intro, resource related to what you discussed].

[Soft CTA for next conversation].
```

## Email Style Guidelines

1. **Be concise but informative** — Get to the point quickly. Busy people skim.
2. **No markdown formatting** — Never use asterisks, bold (**text**), or other markdown. Write plain text that looks natural in any email client.
3. **Short paragraphs** — 2-3 sentences max per paragraph. White space is your friend.
4. **Simple lists** — If listing items, use plain dashes. No fancy formatting.

**Good:**
```
Here's what I can share:
- Case study from a similar company
- 15-min intro call this week
- Quick demo if helpful
```

**Bad:**
```
**What I Can Offer:**
- **Case study** from a similar company
- **Intro call** this week
```

---

## What NOT to Do

**Generic openers:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I'm reaching out because..."
- "I wanted to introduce myself"

**Feature dumps:**
- Long paragraphs about your product
- Multiple value props at once
- No clear CTA

**Fake personalization:**
- "I noticed you work at [Company]" (obviously)
- "Congrats on your role" (without context)

**Markdown in emails:**
- Using **bold** or *italic* asterisks
- Headers or formatted lists that won't render

**Instead:**
- Lead with something specific you learned
- One clear value prop
- One clear ask
- Plain text formatting only

---

## Channel Selection

```
IF verified email available:
  → Email preferred (higher response rate)
  → Also provide LinkedIn backup

IF no email:
  → LinkedIn connection request
  → Follow-up message template for after connection

IF warm intro possible:
  → Suggest mutual connection outreach first
```

---

## Company Configuration [CUSTOMIZE]

```markdown
## Outreach Settings

- My name: [Your Name]
- My title: [Your Title]
- My company: [Company Name]
- Value prop: [One sentence - what you help with]

## Signature
[Your preferred email signature]

## Proof Points
- [Customer 1]: [Result]
- [Customer 2]: [Result]
- [Customer 3]: [Result]

## CTA Options
- Default: "Worth a 15-min call?"
- Softer: "Open to learning more?"
- Specific: "Can I send over a quick demo?"

## Tone
- [Professional / Casual / Direct]
- Industry-specific language: [Yes/No]
```

---

Hi David,

Saw Notion's AI rollout is gaining serious traction - congrats.
With 5 ML roles open, seems like you're scaling fast.

Curious how you're thinking about inference infrastructure
as usage grows. We helped [Similar Company] cut their AI
serving costs 40% while improving latency.

Worth a 15-min call to see if relevant to your roadmap?

Best,
[Name]

---

**Subject Alternatives:**
1. Notion AI + scaling question
2. Quick thought on Notion's ML hiring
