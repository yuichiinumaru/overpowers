# LaminDB

## Overview

LaminDB is an open-source data framework for biology designed to make data queryable, traceable, reproducible, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). It provides a unified platform that combines lakehouse architecture, lineage tracking, feature stores, biological ontologies, LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System), and ELN (Electronic Lab Notebook) capabilities through a single Python API.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Queryability**: Search and filter datasets by metadata, features, and ontology terms
- **Traceability**: Automatic lineage tracking from raw data through analysis to results
- **Reproducibility**: Version control for data, code, and environment
- **FAIR Compliance**: Standardized annotations using biological ontologies

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Managing biological datasets**: scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, flow cytometry, multi-modal data, EHR data
- **Tracking computational workflows**: Notebooks, scripts, pipeline execution (Nextflow, Snakemake, Redun)
- **Curating and validating data**: Schema validation, standardization, ontology-based annotation
- **Working with biological ontologies**: Genes, proteins, cell types, tissues, diseases, pathways (via Bionty)
- **Building data lakehouses**: Unified query interface across multiple datasets
- **Ensuring reproducibility**: Automatic versioning, lineage tracking, environment capture
- **Integrating ML pipelines**: Connecting with Weights & Biases, MLflow, HuggingFace, scVI-tools
- **Deploying data infrastructure**: Setting up local or cloud-based data management systems
- **Collaborating on datasets**: Sharing curated, annotated data with standardized metadata

## Core Capabilities

LaminDB provides six interconnected capability areas, each documented in detail in the references folder.

### 1. Core Concepts and Data Lineage

**Core entities:**
- **Artifacts**: Versioned datasets (DataFrame, AnnData, Parquet, Zarr, etc.)
- **Records**: Experimental entities (samples, perturbations, instruments)
- **Runs & Transforms**: Computational lineage tracking (what code produced what data)
- **Features**: Typed metadata fields for annotation and querying

**Key workflows:**
- Create and version artifacts from files or Python objects
- Track notebook/script execution with `ln.track()` and `ln.finish()`
- Annotate artifacts with typed features
- Visualize data lineage graphs with `artifact.view_lineage()`
- Query by provenance (find all outputs from specific code/inputs)

**Reference:** `references/core-concepts.md` - Read this for detailed information on artifacts, records, runs, transforms, features, versioning, and lineage tracking.

### 2. Data Management and Querying

**Query capabilities:**
- Registry exploration and lookup with auto-complete
- Single record retrieval with `get()`, `one()`, `one_or_none()`
- Filtering with comparison operators (`__gt`, `__lte`, `__contains`, `__startswith`)
- Feature-based queries (query by annotated metadata)
- Cross-registry traversal with double-underscore syntax
- Full-text search across registries
- Advanced logical queries with Q objects (AND, OR, NOT)
- Streaming large datasets without loading into memory

**Key workflows:**
- Browse artifacts with filters and ordering
- Query by features, creation date, creator, size, etc.
- Stream large files in chunks or with array slicing
- Organize data with hierarchical keys
- Group artifacts into collections

**Reference:** `references/data-management.md` - Read this for comprehensive query patterns, filtering examples, streaming strategies, and data organization best practices.

### 3. Annotation and Validation

**Curation process:**
1. **Validation**: Confirm datasets match desired schemas
2. **Standardization**: Fix typos, map synonyms to canonical terms
3. **Annotation**: Link datasets to metadata entities for queryability

**Schema types:**
- **Flexible schemas**: Validate only known columns, allow additional metadata
- **Minimal required schemas**: Specify essential columns, permit extras
- **Strict schemas**: Complete control over structure and values

**Supported data types:**
- DataFrames (Parquet, CSV)
- AnnData (single-cell genomics)
- MuData (multi-modal)
- SpatialData (spatial transcriptomics)
- TileDB-SOMA (scalable arrays)

**Key workflows:**
- Define features and schemas for data validation
- Use `DataFrameCurator` or `AnnDataCurator` for validation
- Standardize values with `.cat.standardize()`
- Map to ontologies with `.cat.add_ontology()`
- Save curated artifacts with schema linkage
- Query validated datasets by features

**Reference:** `references/annotation-validation.md` - Read this for detailed curation workflows, schema design patterns, handling validation errors, and best practices.

### 4. Biological Ontologies

**Available ontologies (via Bionty):**
- Genes (Ensembl), Proteins (UniProt)
- Cell types (CL), Cell lines (CLO)
- Tissues (Uberon), Diseases (Mondo, DOID)
- Phenotypes (HPO), Pathways (GO)
- Experimental factors (EFO), Developmental stages
- Organisms (NCBItaxon), Drugs (DrugBank)

**Key workflows:**
- Import public ontologies with `bt.CellType.import_source()`
- Search ontologies with keyword or exact matching
- Standardize terms using synonym mapping
- Explore hierarchical relationships (parents, children, ancestors)
- Validate data against ontology terms
- Annotate datasets with ontology records
- Create custom terms and hierarchies
- Handle multi-organism contexts (human, mouse, etc.)

**Reference:** `references/ontologies.md` - Read this for comprehensive ontology operations, standardization strategies, hierarchy navigation, and annotation workflows.

```python
import lamindb as ln
import bionty as bt
import anndata as ad

# Start tracking
ln.track(params={"analysis": "scRNA-seq QC and annotation"})

# Import cell type ontology
bt.CellType.import_source()

# Load data
adata = ad.read_h5ad("raw_counts.h5ad")

# Validate and standardize cell types
adata.obs["cell_type"] = bt.CellType.standardize(adata.obs["cell_type"])

# Curate with schema
curator = ln.curators.AnnDataCurator(adata, schema)
curator.validate()
artifact = curator.save_artifact(key="scrna/validated.h5ad")

# Link ontology annotations
cell_types = bt.CellType.from_values(adata.obs.cell_type)
artifact.feature_sets.add_ontology(cell_types)

ln.finish()
```

### Use Case 2: Building a Queryable Data Lakehouse

```python
import lamindb as ln

# Register multiple experiments
for i, file in enumerate(data_files):
    artifact = ln.Artifact.from_anndata(
        ad.read_h5ad(file),
        key=f"scrna/batch_{i}.h5ad",
        description=f"scRNA-seq batch {i}"
    ).save()

    # Annotate with features
    artifact.features.add_values({
        "batch": i,
        "tissue": tissues[i],
        "condition": conditions[i]
    })

# Query across all experiments
immune_datasets = ln.Artifact.filter(
    key__startswith="scrna/",
    tissue="PBMC",
    condition="treated"
).to_dataframe()

# Load specific datasets
for artifact in immune_datasets:
    adata = artifact.load()
    # Analyze
```

### Use Case 3: ML Pipeline with W&B Integration

```python
import lamindb as ln
import wandb

# Initialize both systems
wandb.init(project="drug-response", name="exp-42")
ln.track(params={"model": "random_forest", "n_estimators": 100})

# Load training data from LaminDB
train_artifact = ln.Artifact.get(key="datasets/train.parquet")
train_data = train_artifact.load()

# Train model
model = train_model(train_data)

# Log to W&B
wandb.log({"accuracy": 0.95})

# Save model in LaminDB with W&B linkage
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl")
model_artifact = ln.Artifact("model.pkl", key="models/exp-42.pkl").save()
model_artifact.features.add_values({"wandb_run_id": wandb.run.id})

ln.finish()
wandb.finish()
```

### Use Case 4: Nextflow Pipeline Integration

```python
# In Nextflow process script
import lamindb as ln

ln.track()

# Load input artifact
input_artifact = ln.Artifact.get(key="raw/batch_${batch_id}.fastq.gz")
input_path = input_artifact.cache()

# Process (alignment, quantification, etc.)
# ... Nextflow process logic ...

# Save output
output_artifact = ln.Artifact(
    "counts.csv",
    key="processed/batch_${batch_id}_counts.csv"
).save()

ln.finish()
```

3. **Use ontologies**: Leverage public biological ontologies for standardized annotations

4. **Organize with keys**: Structure artifact keys hierarchically (e.g., `project/experiment/batch/file.h5ad`)

5. **Query metadata first**: Filter and search before loading large files

6. **Version, don't duplicate**: Use built-in versioning instead of creating new keys for modifications

7. **Annotate with features**: Define typed features for queryable metadata

8. **Document thoroughly**: Add descriptions to artifacts, schemas, and transforms

9. **Leverage lineage**: Use `view_lineage()` to understand data provenance

10. **Start local, scale cloud**: Develop locally with SQLite, deploy to cloud with PostgreSQL
