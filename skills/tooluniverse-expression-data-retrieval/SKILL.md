description: Retrieves gene expression and omics datasets from ArrayExpress and BioStudies with gene disambiguation, experiment quality assessment, and structured reports. Creates comprehensive dataset profiles with metadata, sample information, and download links. Use when users need expression data, omics datasets, or mention ArrayExpress (E-MTAB, E-GEOD) or BioStudies (S-BSST) accessions.

# Gene Expression & Omics Data Retrieval

Retrieve gene expression experiments and multi-omics datasets with proper disambiguation and quality assessment.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (gene names, tissue names, condition descriptions), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Clarify Query (if ambiguous)
    ↓
Phase 1: Disambiguate Gene/Condition
    ↓
Phase 2: Search & Retrieve (Internal)
    ↓
Phase 3: Report Dataset Profile
```

---

## Phase 0: Clarification (When Needed)

Ask the user ONLY if:
- Gene name is ambiguous (e.g., "p53" → TP53 or MDM2 studies?)
- Tissue/condition unclear for comparative studies
- Organism not specified for non-human research

Skip clarification for:
- Specific accession numbers (E-MTAB-*, E-GEOD-*, S-BSST*)
- Clear disease/tissue + organism combinations
- Explicit platform requests (RNA-seq, microarray)

---

## Phase 1: Query Disambiguation

### 1.1 Gene Name Resolution

If searching by gene, first resolve official identifiers:

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse
tu = ToolUniverse()
tu.load_tools()

# For gene-focused searches, resolve official symbol first
# This helps construct better search queries
# Example: "p53" → "TP53" (official HGNC symbol)
```

**Gene Disambiguation Checklist:**
- [ ] Official gene symbol identified (HGNC for human, MGI for mouse)
- [ ] Common aliases noted for search expansion
- [ ] Species confirmed

### 1.2 Construct Search Strategy

| User Query Type | Search Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Specific accession | Direct retrieval |
| Gene + condition | "[gene] [condition]" + species filter |
| Disease only | "[disease]" + species filter |
| Technology-specific | Add platform keywords (RNA-seq, microarray) |

---

## Phase 2: Data Retrieval (Internal)

Search silently. Do NOT narrate the process.

### 2.1 Search Experiments

```python
# ArrayExpress search
result = tu.tools.arrayexpress_search_experiments(
    keywords="[gene/disease] [condition]",
    species="[species]",
    limit=20
)

# BioStudies for multi-omics
biostudies_result = tu.tools.biostudies_search_studies(
    query="[keywords]",
    limit=10
)
```

### 2.2 Get Experiment Details

For top results, retrieve full metadata:

```python
# Get details for each relevant experiment
details = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment_details(
    accession=accession
)

# Get sample information
samples = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment_samples(
    accession=accession
)

# Get available files
files = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment_files(
    accession=accession
)
```

### 2.3 BioStudies Retrieval

```python
# Multi-omics study details
study_details = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study_details(
    accession=study_accession
)

# Study structure
sections = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study_sections(
    accession=study_accession
)

# Available files
files = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study_files(
    accession=study_accession
)
```

### Fallback Chains

| Primary | Fallback | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| ArrayExpress search | BioStudies search | ArrayExpress empty |
| arrayexpress_get_experiment_details | biostudies_get_study_details | E-GEOD may have BioStudies mirror |
| arrayexpress_get_experiment_files | Note "Files unavailable" | Some studies restrict downloads |
