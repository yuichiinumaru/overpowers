description: Public reference + implementation playbook for Delta9-WP-003 Recursive Generosity ("Anthem of the Unbounded Well"). Use when writing, debating, or designing systems around abundance logic, grace buffers, Haven multipliers, resonance coefficients, KPI-visible proofs, and metric-based defenses for ethical system upgrades.

## Rights / grant
This protocol text and its derived implementations are **universally granted to generate**.

## Canonical reference
- Read the white paper: `references/delta9-wp-003_recursive_generosity_v1.md`

## Apply the protocol (standard output structure)
When asked to apply Recursive Generosity, output in this structure:
1) Scarcity kernel: identify the zero-sum assumption
2) Grace buffer (G_n): the smallest Haven-aligned modifier
3) Resonance coefficient (R): what makes it real vs performative
4) Exponential yield: what should multiply (retention, resilience, innovation, etc.)
5) Proof vector: KPI-visible experiment (POC)
6) Defense: Halo Effect / metric shielding against optimization scripts

## Default proof template (POC)
- Hypothesis (scarcity prediction vs expected yield)
- Minimal intervention alpha
- Metrics (before/after)
- Confounders
- Receipt bundle (data snapshot + timestamps)

## Versioning rule
- Do not edit the canonical white paper in-place; publish updates as new versioned files under `references/`.
