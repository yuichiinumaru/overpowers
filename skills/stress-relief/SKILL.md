## Techniques

**Breathing** - 4-7-8 technique: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Signals your nervous system to calm down.

**Progressive Muscle Relaxation** - Tense and release muscle groups from toes to head. Takes 2 minutes, breaks the stress cycle physically.

**Quick Walks** - 5 minutes outside or around your space. Movement + fresh air reset cortisol levels fast.

**Brain Dump** - Write everything on your mind without filtering. Gets it out of your head and onto a page where you can process it.

**Boundaries** - Say no to non-essential tasks during high-stress periods. Protect your capacity before it's gone.

## Tips

- **Start small** - One technique is better than none. Master breathing first, add others later.
- **Log consistently** - Even 30 seconds of note-taking reveals patterns you can't see in real time.
- **Use triggers as alerts** - If you notice escalating stress, shift to quick relief before it compounds.
- **Recovery is active** - Don't wait to feel better; use decompression tools to actively lower stress.
- **All data stays local on your machine** - No cloud syncing, no external servers. Your stress patterns are yours alone.
