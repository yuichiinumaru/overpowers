# seedance-prompt

Prompt construction, @Tag reference system, JSON planning schema, and quad-modal protocol for Seedance 2.0.

## Scope

- Five-layer prompt structure (subject/action/camera/style/sound)
- Delegation levels 1–4 and when to use each
- @Tag role assignment and Universal Reference mode
- Quad-modal protocol rules and failure patterns
- JSON prompt schema and compile rules
- Prompt hygiene and anti-slop

## Out of scope

- Camera phrasing library — see [skill:seedance-camera]
- Character identity locking — see [skill:seedance-characters]
- VFX contracts — see [skill:seedance-vfx]
- Audio layers — see [skill:seedance-audio]

## The 6-Part Field Formula (cross-model validated)

From 10,000-generation practitioner data, this structure maps cleanly to the Five-Layer Stack:

```
[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]
```

This baseline works across thousands of generations. It is the field-validated form of the Five-Layer Stack.

> **Front-load rule**: The model weights early words more heavily. `"Beautiful woman dancing"` ≠ `"Woman, beautiful, dancing."` Order matters. Subject + action always first.

> **One action per prompt rule**: Multiple actions create AI confusion. `"Walking while talking while eating"` = chaos. One verb per shot.

---

## The Five-Layer Stack

Build prompts in this order. The model is motion-first; subject anchor before style.

```
1. SUBJECT  — who/what is central (identity anchor)
2. ACTION   — primary motion verb + physics/timing
3. CAMERA   — framing + movement + speed + angle
4. STYLE    — 1–3 tokens max (film language, not adjectives)
5. SOUND    — ambient + SFX + music + silence
+ CONSTRAINTS — what must stay consistent; what to avoid
```

First 20–30 words carry disproportionate weight. Subject + action always first.

---

## Delegation Levels

### Level 1 — Pure Intent (≤30 words)

Use when the model knows the domain (food, brands, sports, everyday life).

```
生成一个精美高级的兰州拉面广告，注意分镜编排
```

The model selects shots, music, pacing independently.

### Level 2 — Guided Direction (30–100 words)

Subject + action + environment + one camera note + one style anchor. Most common production mode.

### Level 3 — Time-Segmented (100–300 words)

Use explicit timestamps: `0–3s: ... 3–7s: ... 7–END: ...`

### Level 4 — Full Choreography (300–1000+ words)

Per-shot specifications. Use for fight scenes, lip-sync, product demos. See [skill:seedance-motion].

**Decision rule:** Does the model already know how to shoot this? Yes → Level 1–2. Novel/precise → Level 3–4.

---

## @Tag System

Entry modes:
- **First/Last Frame (首尾帧):** One image + text. For simple I2V.
- **Universal Reference (全能参考):** Multi-modal. Use for everything else.

Input limits: Images ×9, Videos ×3, Audio ×3, Total files ≤12 (Rule of 12).

### Role assignment patterns

Every @Tag needs one explicit role. A bare tag is weak.

```
@Image1's character as the subject
@Image2 as the first frame / @Image3 as the last frame
Scene references @Image2
Wearing the outfit from @Image3
Reference @Video1's camera movement throughout
BGM references @Audio1
Voice timbre references @Audio1
Match the visual style of @Video1
```

### Reference vs. Edit (critical)

- `参考@Video1的运镜` → generate new content using Video1's technique
- `将@Video1中的人物换成...` → modify Video1 directly

These trigger different model behaviors. Be explicit.

---

## Quad-Modal Rules

### T2V
- Subject + action first
- For known domains: Level 1–2, trust the model
- For novel content: Level 3–4 with explicit structure

### I2V
- `@Image1 as the first frame` for stability
- Add `@Image2 as the last frame` for motion-in-between
- Describe only the change from start image, not the whole scene

### V2V
- State what to keep and what to change
- Limit to 1–2 changes per generation
- Modes: reference (new content from technique) vs. edit (modify directly)

### R2V
- Each reference gets ONE job
- State all role assignments before any other content
- For multi-character: attribute every action by name

---

## JSON Schema v3

See [ref:json-schema] for complete schema, field reference, and compile function.

Minimal example (Level 2):

```json
{
  "v": "3.0",
  "meta": { "mode": "i2v", "level": 2, "dur": 10, "ar": "16:9", "res": "1080p" },
  "ref": { "char": "@Image1", "bg": "@Image2", "cam": "@Video1", "bgm": "@Audio1" },
  "shot": {
    "subj": "weathered woman, wool coat, rain platform",
    "act": "slow turn toward camera, breath misting",
    "cam": "dolly push MS→CU over 8s",
    "light": "overhead practical, warm key, low-fill",
    "style": ["anamorphic", "grain", "muted"],
    "snd": { "amb": "rain bed", "sfx": ["train hum at 1s"], "mx": "piano at 2s" }
  },
  "lock": ["stable exposure", "no drift"],
  "exit": "hold 0.8s"
}
```

**Never paste JSON into Seedance.** JSON = plan. Compile to plain text before submitting.

## Prompt Hygiene

Delete these words — they are unmeasurable:
`cinematic` `epic` `masterpiece` `ultra-real` `award-winning` `stunning` `8K`

Replace with observable controls:

| ❌ | ✅ |
|---|---|
| cinematic lighting | single hard key 45° camera-left, warm amber, deep shadow |
| epic | wide shot, slow push-in, rising wind, low drone, crescendo at 6s |
| high quality | stable exposure, no flicker, clean edges |

**Conflict check** — never combine:
- locked-off + handheld
- bright flat + low-key shadows
- rapid cuts + long-take

## ⚠️ Copyright & Content Policy

Full rules, substitution tables, and architecture/music/audio policy → [skill:seedance-copyright]

**Summary hard blocks**: real celebrity faces · named franchise characters (Iron Man, Naruto, Mario) · named game characters · brand logos · copyrighted scene recreations · named musical compositions.

**Core rule**: describe the *look*, never the *name*.

| ❌ Blocked | ✅ Safe substitute |
|---|---|
| Iron Man | red-and-gold powered exoskeleton, chest reactor glow |
| Naruto | blond spiky-haired shinobi, orange jumpsuit, whisker scars |
| Batman | dark armoured vigilante, scalloped cape |
| Eiffel Tower night lights | glass lattice tower with illuminated night display |
| Bohemian Rhapsody as score | operatic rock build, piano into power chords, multi-voice choir |

For living real persons: never generate by name or distinctive likeness. Use archetype: `"tech billionaire in black T-shirt"` not `"Elon Musk"`.

## 🚫 Anti-Slop Protocol

Full blacklist, decomposition patterns, and before/after repairs → [skill:seedance-antislop]

**The one test**: *Can a camera, light meter, or stopwatch measure this word?* If no → delete it.

**Instant-delete list**: `stunning` · `cinematic` · `epic` · `masterpiece` · `beautiful` · `breathtaking` · `8K` · `ultra-real` · `award-winning` · `immersive` · `ethereal` · `magical` · `otherworldly`

**Replace with observable controls**:

| ❌ Slop | ✅ Measurable |
|---|---|
| cinematic lighting | 45° hard key camera-left, amber gel, deep shadow camera-right |
| epic scene | wide shot, dolly pull reveals 200 soldiers, brass swell at 4 s |
| stunning sunset | warm backlight 3200K, 5 min post-horizon, long silhouette shadows |
| 8K ultra-real | stable exposure, no flicker, clean edges, no hallucinated geometry |
| ethereal forest | heavy fog, god rays through canopy, cool teal cast, dust motes |

## Agent gotchas

1. Place subject + action in the first 20–30 words. Everything else is secondary.
2. One primary motion verb per shot. Competing verbs = chaos.
3. Positive specification beats long negative lists.
4. Budget discipline: every word must be verifiable in-frame or in-audio.
5. For Level 1: the delegation command `注意分镜编排` activates director intelligence. Add it and step back.
6. **Audio is not optional.** Practitioners with 10,000+ generations confirm: ignoring audio produces flat results regardless of visual quality. Always specify ambient + SFX + music/silence decision.
7. **Seed discipline.** Seed control is available at API level (seed=-1 for random; set integer for reproducibility). On the web platform, seed configurability is not confirmed. When API launches: test seeds 1000–1010 on same prompt, build a typed seed library.
8. **First frame obsession.** Generate 10 variants of just the first frame. First-frame quality predicts entire video outcome. Select best, then build.
9. **Post-Feb-15 content gate.** Any named character (franchise, anime, game, streamer original) or named real person will trigger refusal or degraded output. Run [skill:seedance-copyright] check before submission.
