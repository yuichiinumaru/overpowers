# Scene Writing Skill

## Purpose

Write individual screenplay scenes that advance the story, reveal character, and engage the reader. Each scene should be a complete dramatic unit with its own structure, conflict, and resolution.

## Scene Anatomy

### The SCENE Framework

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **S**pacing | INT/EXT, Location, Time |
| **C**haracter | Who's in the scene, POV |
| **E**motion | Underlying tension, stakes |
| **N**arrative | Information delivered |
| **E**xit | How we leave, hook to next |

## Screenplay Format (Fountain)

```fountain
INT. POLICE PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Harsh fluorescent light. Bare walls. A metal table bolted to the floor.

DETECTIVE SARAH CHEN (40s, tired eyes, sharp mind) sits across from MARCUS WEBB (30s, expensive suit, expensive smile).

A manila folder between them like a dare.

                    SARAH
          You know why you're here.

                    MARCUS
                (leaning back)
          Enlighten me.

Sarah opens the folder. Crime scene photos. Blood. Chaos.

                    SARAH
          Your fingerprints. Her blood.
          Her dying breath, calling out
          your name.

Marcus doesn't flinch. His smile never wavers.

                    MARCUS
          Detective... I have an alibi.

                    SARAH
          So did every guilty man I ever caught.

She slides one photo across the table. Marcus looks at it.

For just a moment—something flickers in his eyes.

                    MARCUS
          I want my lawyer.

Sarah smiles. Finally. A crack.
```

## Formatting Rules

### Slugline (Scene Heading)
```
INT. or EXT.
LOCATION NAME (in caps)
TIME OF DAY (DAY, NIGHT, CONTINUOUS, LATER, SAME)
```

Examples:
- `INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY`
- `EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT`
- `INT./EXT. CAR (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS`

### Action Lines
- Present tense, active voice
- 3-4 lines max per paragraph
- WHITE SPACE for pacing
- CHARACTER NAMES in CAPS on first appearance
- Sounds in CAPS (BANG, CRASH)
- Only describe what we SEE and HEAR

### Dialogue
- Character name centered, ALL CAPS
- Parentheticals (sparingly) for tone/direction
- Dialogue left-aligned under name
- Keep speeches short—film is visual

### Transitions
- Use sparingly: `CUT TO:`, `SMASH CUT TO:`, `DISSOLVE TO:`
- Most scene changes are implied cuts
- `FADE IN:` at start, `FADE OUT.` at end

## Scene Structure

### Mini Three-Act
Every scene has its own structure:

**Beginning (10%)**
- Establish location/time
- Character enters situation
- Scene goal introduced

**Middle (80%)**
- Conflict develops
- Stakes escalate
- Complications arise
- Information delivered

**End (10%)**
- Scene climax
- Value shift
- Hook to next scene

### Value Shift
Every scene should shift a value:
- Hope → Despair
- Trust → Suspicion
- Power → Vulnerability
- Ignorance → Knowledge

## Scene Types

### Dialogue Scene
- Characters talking
- Subtext underneath
- Physical action woven in
- Avoid "talking heads"

### Action Scene
- Visual storytelling
- Minimal dialogue
- Clear geography
- Beat-by-beat choreography

### Montage
- Series of shots
- Passage of time
- Unified by theme or music
- Each shot advances story

### Intercut
- Parallel action
- Multiple locations
- Build tension through comparison
- `> INTERCUT - LOCATION A/LOCATION B`

## Writing Tips

### Pacing
```
Fast pace:
- Short sentences.
- Fragments.
- White space.
- Action verbs.

Slower pace:
The room settles into silence. Dust motes drift through the
shaft of light from the window. Somewhere, a clock ticks.
```

### Visual Writing
**Instead of:** "John is sad about his breakup."
**Write:** "John sits alone at a table for two. An untouched birthday cake. Two candles, unlit."

### Subtext
**On the nose:** "I'm angry at you for lying!"
**Subtext:** "Did you have a nice evening?"

## Scene Checklist

- [ ] Does the scene advance plot?
- [ ] Does it reveal character?
- [ ] Is there conflict?
- [ ] Does a value shift?
- [ ] Could any lines be cut?
- [ ] Is there subtext?
- [ ] Does it end with a hook?
- [ ] Is formatting correct?

## Common Mistakes

1. **Overwriting** - Trust the reader
2. **Camera directions** - Not your job
3. **Internal thoughts** - Can't be filmed
4. **Too much dialogue** - Show, don't tell
5. **No conflict** - Every scene needs tension
6. **Weak endings** - End on strength

## Output Format

```fountain
INT. [LOCATION] - [TIME]

[Opening action/description - 2-3 lines]

[CHARACTER NAME] ([age, brief description]) [action].

                    [CHARACTER]
          [Dialogue]

[Action/response]

                    [OTHER CHARACTER]
                ([parenthetical])
          [Dialogue]

[Scene climax/turning point]

[Exit action - hook to next scene]
```
