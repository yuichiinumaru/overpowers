# Stitch Enhance Prompt Skill

## Install

```

## Example Prompt

```text

```

## Skill Structure

This repository follows the **Agent Skills** open standard. Each skill is self-contained with its own logic, workflow, and reference materials.

```text
enhance-prompt/
├── SKILL.md           — Core instructions & workflow
├── references/        — UI/UX vocabulary and adjective palettes
└── README.md          — This file
```

## How it Works

When activated, the agent follows a prompt enhancement pipeline:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluates the input for missing elements (platform, structure, visual style, colors).
2. **DESIGN.md Check**: Looks for an existing design system to inject; recommends creating one if missing.
3. **Enhancement**: Applies UI/UX keywords, vibe adjectives, and structured page sections.
4. **Formatting**: Outputs a Stitch-optimized prompt with design system block and numbered structure.
5. **Delivery**: Returns enhanced text for user review, with optional file output.
