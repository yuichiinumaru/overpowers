## Step 2: Generate the Devotional Message

Create a warm, pastoral devotion based on the verse. The tone should be like a caring pastor speaking directly to a beloved congregation member.

### Devotion Structure:

1. **Opening Hook** (1-2 sentences)
   - Start with a relatable life scenario or question that connects to the verse
   - Draw the reader in immediately

2. **Verse Context** (2-3 sentences)
   - Provide brief historical or cultural context of the passage
   - Explain who wrote it, to whom, and why

3. **Core Message** (3-4 sentences)
   - Unpack the meaning of the verse
   - Explain how it applies to modern life
   - Use warm, encouraging language

4. **Cross-References** (1-2 verses)
   - Include 1-2 related scripture references that reinforce the message
   - Briefly explain the connection

5. **Personal Application** (2-3 sentences)
   - Speak directly to the reader using "you"
   - Be encouraging and uplifting
   - Acknowledge struggles while pointing to hope

6. **Today's Challenge** (Dynamic - NEVER repeat the same challenge)
   - Provide ONE practical, actionable step the user can take today
   - **Vary the duration**: Use 3-15 minutes based on context and activity type
   - **Vary the activity**: Rotate between silence, meditation, journaling, action, prayer, worship
   - **Personalize**: Tailor to the verse theme and user's known context/profile

   **Example Challenge Templates (pick ONE and adapt to the verse):**
   1. "Set aside [3-10] minutes to [meditate/journal/reflect] on [theme from verse]..."
   2. "Before your next [meeting/task/meal], take [2-5] minutes to [action related to verse]..."
   3. "Write down [number] ways you can [apply verse principle] today..."
   4. "During your [commute/break/walk], spend [time] [speaking/listening/reflecting] on [verse theme]..."
   5. "Send a [message/note/text] to someone expressing [gratitude/encouragement/love] as the verse teaches..."
   6. "Tonight before bed, [specific reflection activity] for [3-7] minutes..."
   7. "Pause three times today to silently thank God for [verse-related blessing]..."
   8. "Choose one person to [encourage/forgive/help/pray for] as a response to this verse..."
   9. "Take a [5-10] minute prayer walk, focusing on [verse theme]..."
   10. "Write a short prayer in your own words inspired by today's scripture..."
   11. "Find a quiet moment to read [related passage] and compare its message to today's verse..."
   12. "Speak today's verse out loud [3-5] times to let it sink into your spirit..."
   13. "Share this verse with someone who might need its encouragement today..."
   14. "Before each meal today, reflect on one aspect of [verse theme]..."
   15. "Create a simple reminder (phone wallpaper, sticky note) of today's verse..."
   16. "At the end of your workday, spend [5] minutes reviewing how you applied this verse..."
   17. "Listen to a worship song that reflects the theme of [verse theme]..."
   18. "Journal about a time when you experienced [the truth of this verse]..."
   19. "Take [10] minutes to sit in complete silence, letting God's [grace/peace/love] wash over you..."
   20. "Identify one habit you can adjust today to better align with [verse principle]..."
   21. "Practice [forgiveness/patience/gratitude/trust] in your next challenging interaction..."
   22. "Memorize today's verse by writing it out [3-5] times..."
   23. "Invite the Holy Spirit to reveal one area of your life that needs [verse theme]..."
   24. "Set an alarm for [time] to pause and re-read today's verse wherever you are..."

### Tone Guidelines:
- **Warm and pastoral** - Like a loving shepherd caring for sheep
- **Encouraging** - Focus on hope, not condemnation
- **Personal** - Use "you" and "we" to create connection
- **Accessible** - Avoid overly theological jargon
- **Uplifting** - Leave the reader feeling encouraged and empowered

## Step 3: Handle Prayer Context

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT ask the user for prayer requests interactively.** Prayer requests should be included in the initial prompt when the user invokes the skill.

**If prayer requests are provided in the prompt:**
- Incorporate them naturally into Part 4 of the prayer
- Be sensitive and respectful with personal matters
- If work-related, refer to it simply as "work" or "workplace"
- If health-related, pray for healing and strength
- If relationship-related, pray for wisdom and reconciliation
- If finances are mentioned, pray for provision and wise stewardship

**If no prayer context is provided:**
- Use general prayers for daily guidance and protection
- Pray for the user's family and loved ones generically
- Focus more on the verse application

---

## Step 4: Craft the Structured Prayer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ALWAYS use FIRST-PERSON perspective** in the prayer. Use "I", "my", "me" when referring to the user—NEVER refer to them by name in third-person (e.g., say "my family" not "Eric's family").

Create a prayer following this 6-part structure. The prayer should flow naturally as one continuous conversation with God.

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER repeat the same phrases across different devotions.** Each prayer should feel fresh and unique. Rotate through the example phrases and create new variations.

### Part 1: Praising the Lord
Begin by glorifying God's attributes. **ROTATE through varied openings:**

**Example Openings (vary each time - pick ONE):**

3. "Almighty God, my heart overflows with praise for who You are..."
4. "Father of lights, I lift my voice to exalt Your holy name..."
5. "Sovereign Lord, I stand amazed at Your greatness..."
6. "Gracious God, I enter Your presence with thanksgiving and praise..."
7. "Most High God, I worship You for Your unmatched glory..."
8. "Eternal Father, my soul magnifies Your wonderful name..."
9. "Lord of all creation, I honor You with all that I am..."
10. "Holy One of Israel, I come with reverence into Your presence..."
11. "Mighty God, I celebrate Your power and endless love..."
12. "Faithful Father, I praise You for Your steadfast devotion..."
13. "King of Kings, I kneel before Your awesome throne..."
14. "God of all comfort, I bless Your name this day..."
15. "Wonderful Counselor, I lift high Your glorious name..."
16. "Prince of Peace, I worship You with a grateful heart..."
17. "Ancient of Days, I stand in wonder at Your eternal nature..."
18. "Lord of Hosts, I exalt You above all earthly things..."
19. "Rock of Ages, I praise You for being my firm foundation..."
