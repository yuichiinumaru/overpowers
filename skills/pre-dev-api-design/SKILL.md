# API/Contract Design - Defining Component Interfaces

## Foundational Principle

**Component contracts and interfaces must be defined before technology/protocol selection.**

Jumping to implementation without contract definition creates:
- Integration failures discovered during development
- Inconsistent data structures across components
- Teams blocked waiting for interface clarity
- Rework when assumptions about contracts differ

**The API Design answers**: WHAT data/operations components expose and consume?
**The API Design never answers**: HOW those are implemented (protocols, serialization, specific tech).

## Phase 0: API Standards Discovery (MANDATORY)

**Before defining contracts, check for organizational naming standards.**

See [shared-patterns/standards-discovery.md](../shared-patterns/standards-discovery.md) for complete workflow.

**Context:** API field naming standards
**Output:** `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/api-standards-ref.md`

Use AskUserQuestion tool:

**Question:** "Do you have a data dictionary or API field naming standards to reference?"
- Header: "API Standards"
- multiSelect: false
- Options:
  - "No - Use industry best practices" (description: "Generate contracts using standard naming conventions")
  - "Yes - URL to document" (description: "Provide a URL to your data dictionary or standards document")
  - "Yes - File path" (description: "Provide a local file path (.md, .json, .yaml, .csv)")

### If "Yes" Selected:

**1. Load the document:**

| Source Type | Tool | Actions |
|------------|------|---------|
| URL | WebFetch | Fetch document content; parse for field definitions, naming rules, validation patterns |
| File path | Read | Read file content; support .md (Markdown tables), .json (structured), .yaml (structured), .csv (tabular) |

**2. Extract standards:**

MUST extract these elements if present:

| Element | What to Extract | Example |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Field naming convention** | camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase | `userId` vs `user_id` |
| **Standard field names** | Common fields used across APIs | `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `isActive` |
| **Data type formats** | How to represent dates, IDs, amounts | ISO8601, UUID v4, Decimal(10,2) |
| **Validation patterns** | Regex, constraints, rules | Email RFC 5322, phone E.164 |
| **Standard error codes** | Organizational error naming | `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS` vs `DuplicateEmail` |
| **Pagination fields** | Standard query/response pagination | `page`, `pageSize`, `totalCount` |

**3. Save extracted standards:**

Output to: `docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/api-standards-ref.md`

Format:
```markdown
# API Standards Reference - {Feature Name}

Source: {URL or file path}
Extracted: {timestamp}

## Field Naming Conventions
- IDs: `{pattern}` (example)
- Timestamps: `{pattern}` (example)
- Booleans: `{pattern}` (example)
- Collections: `{pattern}` (example)

## Standard Fields
| Field | Type | Format | Validation | Example |
|-------|------|--------|------------|---------|
| userId | string | UUID v4 | Required, unique | "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" |
| email | string | RFC 5322 | Required, unique | "user@example.com" |
| createdAt | string | ISO 8601 | Auto-generated | "2026-01-23T10:30:00Z" |

## Standard Error Codes
| Code | Usage | HTTP Equivalent (for reference) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------|
| EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS | Duplicate email registration | 409 Conflict |
| INVALID_INPUT | Validation failure | 400 Bad Request |

## Validation Patterns
| Pattern Type | Rule | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Email | RFC 5322, max 254 chars | "user@example.com" |
| Phone | E.164 format | "+5511987654321" |

## Pagination Standards
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| page | integer | 1-indexed page number |
| pageSize | integer | Items per page (max 100) |
| totalCount | integer | Total items across all pages |
```

**4. Apply throughout Gate 4:**

- **Use standard field names** in operation definitions
- **Reference validation patterns** in contract constraints
- **Apply naming conventions** consistently
- **Note any justified deviations** with rationale

### If Dictionary Conflicts with Existing Codebase:

If Phase 0 from Gate 0 (Research) found existing patterns that conflict with the dictionary:

**STOP and use AskUserQuestion:**

**Question:** "Dictionary says `{dictionary_pattern}`, but codebase uses `{codebase_pattern}`. Which should we follow?"
- Header: "Standards Conflict"
- multiSelect: false
- Options:
  - "Follow dictionary" (description: "Use organizational standards, refactor existing code later")
  - "Follow codebase" (description: "Maintain consistency with existing implementation")
  - "Hybrid approach" (description: "Let me decide per-field")

### If "No" Selected (Industry Best Practices):

Proceed with standard naming conventions:
- camelCase for field names (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- snake_case for field names (Python/Ruby/SQL)
- ISO 8601 for timestamps
- UUID v4 for identifiers
- RFC 5322 for emails

**Document the choice** in `api-standards-ref.md` with rationale.

## Mandatory Workflow

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| **0. API Standards Discovery** | Check for organizational field naming standards (data dictionary); load from URL or file if provided; extract field conventions, types, validation patterns; save to `api-standards-ref.md` for reference throughout gate |
| **1. Contract Analysis** | Load approved TRD (Gate 3), Feature Map (Gate 2), PRD (Gate 1); identify integration points from TRD component diagram; extract data flows |
| **2. Contract Definition** | Per interface: define operations, specify inputs/outputs, define errors, document events, set constraints (validation), version contracts; **apply standards from Phase 0 if available** |
| **3. Gate 4 Validation** | Verify all checkboxes in validation checklist before proceeding to Data Modeling |

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include
Operation names/descriptions, input parameters (name, type, required/optional, constraints), output structure (fields, types, nullable), error codes/descriptions, event types/payloads, validation rules, idempotency requirements, auth/authz needs (abstract), versioning strategy

### ❌ NEVER Include
HTTP verbs (GET/POST/PUT), gRPC/GraphQL/WebSocket details, URL paths/routes, serialization formats (JSON/Protobuf), framework code, database queries, infrastructure, specific auth libraries

### Abstraction Rules

| Element | Abstract (✅) | Protocol-Specific (❌) |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Operation | "CreateUser" | "POST /api/v1/users" |
| Data Type | "EmailAddress (validated)" | "string with regex" |
| Error | "UserAlreadyExists" | "HTTP 409 Conflict" |
| Auth | "Requires authenticated user" | "JWT Bearer token" |
| Format | "ISO8601 timestamp" | "time.RFC3339" |

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "No need to ask about data dictionary" | Organizations have standards. Check first, don't assume. Phase 0 is MANDATORY. |
| "I'll just use common sense for field names" | "Common sense" varies. Ask for standards, or explicitly choose best practices. |
| "Skip Phase 0, user will mention standards if important" | User doesn't know when to mention it. YOU must ask proactively. |
| "REST is obvious, just document endpoints" | Protocol choice goes in Dependency Map. Define contracts abstractly. |
| "We need HTTP codes for errors" | Error semantics matter; HTTP codes are protocol. Abstract the errors. |
| "Teams need to see JSON examples" | JSON is serialization. Define structure; format comes later. |
| "The contract IS the OpenAPI spec" | OpenAPI is protocol-specific. Design contracts first, generate specs later. |
| "gRPC/GraphQL affects the contract" | Protocols deliver contracts. Design protocol-agnostic contracts first. |
| "We already know it's REST" | Knowing doesn't mean documenting prematurely. Stay abstract. |
| "Framework validates inputs" | Validation logic is universal. Document rules; implementation comes later. |
| "This feels redundant with TRD" | TRD = components exist. API = how they talk. Different concerns. |
| "URL structure matters for APIs" | URLs are HTTP-specific. Focus on operations and data. |
| "But API Design means REST API" | API = interface. Could be REST, gRPC, events, or in-process. Stay abstract. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in API Design, **STOP**:

- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- URL paths (/api/v1/users, /users/{id})
- Protocol names (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket)
- Status codes (200, 404, 500)
- Serialization formats (JSON, XML, Protobuf)
- Authentication tokens (JWT, OAuth2 tokens, API keys)
- Framework code (Express routes, gRPC service definitions)
- Transport mechanisms (HTTP/2, TCP, UDP)

**When you catch yourself**: Replace protocol detail with abstract contract. "POST /users" → "CreateUser operation"

## Gate 4 Validation Checklist

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **Contract Completeness** | All component-to-component interactions have contracts; all external integrations covered; all event/message contracts defined; client-facing APIs specified |
| **Operation Clarity** | Each operation has clear purpose/description; consistent naming convention; idempotency documented; batch operations identified |
| **Data Specification** | All inputs typed and documented; required vs optional explicit; outputs complete; null/empty cases handled |
| **Error Handling** | All scenarios identified; error codes/types defined; actionable messages; retry/recovery documented |
| **Event Contracts** | All events named/described; payloads specified; ordering/delivery semantics documented; versioning defined |
| **Constraints & Policies** | Validation rules explicit; timeouts specified; backward compatibility exists |
| **Technology Agnostic** | No protocol specifics; no serialization formats; no framework names; implementable in any protocol |

**Gate Result:** ✅ PASS (all checked) → Data Modeling | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (remove protocol details) | ❌ FAIL (incomplete)

**Action:** 80+ autonomous generation | 50-79 present options | <50 ask clarifying questions

---

## Document Placement

**api-design.md is a backend document** - it defines API contracts implemented by backend services.

| Structure | api-design.md Location |
|-----------|------------------------|
| single-repo | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/api-design.md` |
| monorepo | `{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/api-design.md` |
| multi-repo | `{backend.path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}/api-design.md` |

**Why backend path?** API contracts are:
- Implemented by backend engineers
- Referenced during backend code review
- Versioned with backend code

**Directory creation for multi-module:**
```bash
# Read topology from research.md frontmatter
backend_path="${topology_modules_backend_path:-"."}"
mkdir -p "${backend_path}/docs/pre-dev/{feature}"
```

---

## BFF Contract Design (Frontend-only and Fullstack with BFF)

**⛔ HARD GATE:** If `api_pattern: bff` (from research.md), this section is MANDATORY.

### When This Applies

Check research.md frontmatter:
```yaml
topology:
  scope: frontend-only | fullstack
  api_pattern: bff  # ← This triggers BFF contract design
```

### Phase 3: BFF Contract Definition

**After backend contracts (Phase 2), define BFF-to-Frontend contracts:**

| Step | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Identify all frontend components that need data |
| 2 | Map component data needs to backend APIs |
| 3 | Define BFF aggregation operations |
| 4 | Specify BFF response contracts (frontend-optimized shapes) |
| 5 | Document error normalization strategy |

### BFF Contract Template

**Add to api-design.md under `## BFF Contracts` section:**

```markdown
## BFF Contracts

### Overview
- **Pattern:** BFF (Backend-for-Frontend)
- **Purpose:** [Aggregation | Transformation | Security | All]
- **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js | React | Vue | etc.]

### BFF Operations

#### Operation: Get{Feature}Data

**Purpose:** Aggregate data for {feature} component

**Frontend Consumer:** `{ComponentName}.tsx`

**Backend APIs Consumed:**
| API | Operation | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| User Service | GetUser | User profile data |
| Order Service | ListOrders | Recent orders |

**Input Contract:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Constraints | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| userId | Identifier | Yes | Valid UUID | Target user |
| limit | Integer | No | 1-100, default 10 | Max orders |

**Output Contract (Frontend-Optimized):**
| Field | Type | Nullable | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| user | UserSummary | No | Simplified user object |
| user.id | Identifier | No | User ID |
| user.displayName | String | No | Formatted name |
| recentOrders | OrderSummary[] | No | Last N orders |
| recentOrders[].id | Identifier | No | Order ID |
| recentOrders[].total | FormattedCurrency | No | Display-ready total |

**Error Normalization:**
| Backend Error | BFF Error Code | Frontend Action |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| User 404 | USER_NOT_FOUND | Redirect to error page |
| Orders 500 | ORDERS_UNAVAILABLE | Show partial data |
| Auth 401 | SESSION_EXPIRED | Trigger re-auth |
```

### Type Transformation Rules

**BFF MUST transform backend types to frontend-optimized types:**

| Backend Type | Frontend Type | Transformation |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| ISO8601 string | RelativeTime | "2 hours ago" |
| Decimal amount | FormattedCurrency | "$1,234.56" |
| Full entity | Summary object | Select display fields |
| Nested IDs | Resolved names | Join data |

### Frontend-only Specific Requirements

**If `topology.scope: frontend-only`:**

The BFF consumes EXISTING backend APIs (documented in PRD Data Sources).

**MUST verify:**
1. All PRD Data Sources are covered by BFF operations
2. All API gaps identified in PRD have corresponding BFF operations
3. BFF operations match frontend component data needs

```markdown
### PRD Data Source Coverage

| PRD Data Source | Covered by BFF Operation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------|
| User API | GetDashboardData | User summary included |
| Orders API | GetDashboardData | Recent orders included |
| Reports API | GenerateReport | New BFF operation |
```

### Gate 4 Validation Addition for BFF

| Category | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **BFF Completeness** | All frontend components have data contracts; all backend APIs mapped to BFF operations; error normalization defined; type transformations documented |

### Rationalization Table for BFF Contracts

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "BFF is just a proxy" | Proxies still transform errors and aggregate. Document contracts. |
| "Frontend types are implementation" | Types define component contracts. Design them here. |
| "We'll figure out transformations later" | Later = bugs. Define transformations upfront. |
| "Backend contract = frontend contract" | Backend serves multiple clients. Frontend needs optimized shapes. |
| "BFF contracts are obvious from UI" | Obvious to you ≠ documented. Write explicit contracts. |

## After Approval

1. ✅ Lock contracts - interfaces are now implementation reference
2. 🎯 Use contracts as input for Data Modeling (`ring:pre-dev-data-model`)
3. 🚫 Never add protocol specifics retroactively
4. 📋 Keep technology-agnostic until Dependency Map

## The Bottom Line

**If you wrote API contracts with HTTP endpoints or gRPC services, remove them.**

Contracts are protocol-agnostic. Period. No REST. No GraphQL. No HTTP codes.

Protocol choices go in Dependency Map. That's a later phase. Wait for it.

**Define the contract. Stay abstract. Choose protocol later.**
