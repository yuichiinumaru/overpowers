# Using Ring Technical Writing Specialists

The ring-tw-team plugin provides specialized agents for technical documentation. Use them via `Task tool with subagent_type:`.

**Remember:** Follow the **ORCHESTRATOR principle** from `ring:using-ring`. Dispatch agents to handle documentation tasks; don't write complex documentation directly.

## 3 Documentation Specialists

| Agent | Specialization | Use When |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| `ring:functional-writer` | Conceptual docs, guides, tutorials, best practices, workflows | Writing product guides, tutorials, "how to" content |
| `ring:api-writer` | REST API reference, endpoints, schemas, errors, field descriptions | Documenting API endpoints, request/response examples |
| `ring:docs-reviewer` | Voice/tone, structure, completeness, clarity, accuracy | Reviewing drafts, pre-publication quality check |

---

## Documentation Standards Summary

### Voice and Tone
- **Assertive, but never arrogant** – Say what needs to be said, clearly
- **Encouraging and empowering** – Guide users through complexity
- **Tech-savvy, but human** – Use technical terms when needed, prioritize clarity
- **Humble and open** – Confident but always learning

### Capitalization
- **Sentence case** for all headings and titles
- Only first letter and proper nouns capitalized
- ✅ "Getting started with the API"
- ❌ "Getting Started With The API"

### Structure Patterns
1. Lead with clear definition paragraph
2. Use bullet points for key characteristics
3. Separate sections with `---` dividers
4. Include info boxes and warnings where needed
5. Link to related API reference
6. Add code examples for technical topics

## Dispatching Specialists

**Parallel dispatch** for comprehensive documentation (single message, multiple Tasks):

```
Task #1: functional-writer (write the guide)
Task #2: api-writer (write API reference)
(Both run in parallel)

Then:
Task #3: docs-reviewer (review both)
```

## Integration with Other Plugins

| Plugin | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| ring:using-ring (default) | ORCHESTRATOR principle |
| ring:using-dev-team | Developer agents for technical accuracy |
| ring:using-pm-team | Pre-dev planning before documentation |

---

## ORCHESTRATOR Principle

- **You're the orchestrator** – Dispatch specialists, don't write directly
- **Let specialists apply standards** – They know voice, tone, structure
- **Combine with other plugins** – API writers + backend engineers for accuracy

> ✅ "I need documentation for the new feature. Let me dispatch functional-writer."
>
> ❌ "I'll manually write all the documentation myself."
