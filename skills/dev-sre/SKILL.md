# SRE Validation (Gate 2)

## Overview

This skill VALIDATES that observability was correctly implemented by developers:
- Structured logging with trace correlation
- OpenTelemetry tracing instrumentation
- Code instrumentation coverage (90%+ required)
- Context propagation for distributed tracing

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**Developers IMPLEMENT observability. SRE VALIDATES it.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **Developers** (Gate 0) | IMPLEMENT observability following Ring Standards |
| **SRE Agent** (Gate 2) | VALIDATE that observability is correctly implemented |
| **Implementation Agent** | FIX issues found by SRE (if any) |

**If observability is missing or incorrect:**
1. SRE reports issues with severity levels
2. This skill dispatches fixes to the implementation agent
3. SRE re-validates after fixes
4. Max 3 iterations, then escalate to user

---

## Step 1: Validate Input

<verify_before_proceed>
- unit_id exists
- language is valid (go|typescript|python)
- service_type is valid (api|worker|batch|cli|library)
- implementation_agent exists
- implementation_files is not empty
</verify_before_proceed>

```text
REQUIRED INPUT (from ring:dev-cycle orchestrator):
- unit_id: [task/subtask being validated]
- language: [go|typescript|python]
- service_type: [api|worker|batch|cli|library]
- implementation_agent: [agent that did Gate 0]
- implementation_files: [list of files from Gate 0]

OPTIONAL INPUT:
- external_dependencies: [HTTP clients, gRPC clients, queues]
- gate0_handoff: [summary from Gate 0]
- gate1_handoff: [summary from Gate 1]

if any REQUIRED input is missing:
  → STOP and report: "Missing required input: [field]"
  → Return to orchestrator with error
```

## Step 2: Initialize Validation State

```text
validation_state = {
  iteration: 1,
  max_iterations: 3,
  sre_result: null,
  issues: [],
  instrumentation_coverage: null
}
```

## Step 3: Dispatch SRE Agent for Validation

<dispatch_required agent="ring:sre">
Validate observability implementation for unit_id.
</dispatch_required>

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "ring:sre"
  description: "Validate observability for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ VALIDATE Observability Implementation

    ## Input Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Language:** [language]
    - **Service Type:** [service_type]
    - **Implementation Agent:** [implementation_agent]
    - **Files to Validate:** [implementation_files]
    - **External Dependencies:** [external_dependencies or "None"]

    ## Standards Reference
    WebFetch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/sre.md

    ## Your Role
    - VALIDATE that observability is implemented correctly
    - Do not implement - only verify and report
    - Check structured JSON logging
    - Check OpenTelemetry instrumentation coverage
    - Check context propagation for external calls

    ## Validation Checklist

    ### 0. FORBIDDEN Logging Patterns (CRITICAL - Check FIRST)

    Any occurrence = CRITICAL severity, automatic FAIL verdict.

    <forbidden>
    - fmt.Println() in Go code
    - fmt.Printf() in Go code
    - log.Println() in Go code
    - log.Printf() in Go code
    - log.Fatal() in Go code
    - println() in Go code
    - console.log() in TypeScript
    - console.error() in TypeScript
    - console.warn() in TypeScript
    </forbidden>

    **MUST search for and report all occurrences of FORBIDDEN patterns:**

    | Language | FORBIDDEN Pattern | Search For |
    |----------|-------------------|------------|
    | Go | `fmt.Println()` | `fmt.Println` in *.go files |
    | Go | `fmt.Printf()` | `fmt.Printf` in *.go files |
    | Go | `log.Println()` | `log.Println` in *.go files |
    | Go | `log.Printf()` | `log.Printf` in *.go files |
    | Go | `log.Fatal()` | `log.Fatal` in *.go files |
    | Go | `println()` | `println(` in *.go files |
    | TypeScript | `console.log()` | `console.log` in *.ts files |
    | TypeScript | `console.error()` | `console.error` in *.ts files |
    | TypeScript | `console.warn()` | `console.warn` in *.ts files |

    **If any FORBIDDEN pattern found:**
    - Severity: **CRITICAL**
    - Verdict: **FAIL** (automatic, no exceptions)
    - Each occurrence MUST be listed with file:line

    ### 1. Structured Logging (lib-commons)
    - [ ] Uses `libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext(ctx)` for logger (Go)
    - [ ] Uses `initializeLogger()` from lib-common-js (TypeScript)
    - [ ] JSON format with timestamp, level, message, service
    - [ ] trace_id correlation in logs
    - [ ] **no FORBIDDEN patterns** (see check 0 above)

    ### 2. Instrumentation Coverage (90%+ required)
    For [language], check these patterns:

    **Go (lib-commons):**
    ```go
    logger, tracer, _, _ := libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext(ctx)
    ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "layer.operation")
    defer span.End()
    ```

    **TypeScript:**
    ```typescript
    const span = tracer.startSpan('layer.operation');
    try { /* work */ } finally { span.end(); }
    ```

    Count spans in:
    - Handlers: grep "tracer.Start" in *handler*.go or *controller*.ts
    - Services: grep "tracer.Start" in *service*.go or *service*.ts
    - Repositories: grep "tracer.Start" in *repo*.go or *repository*.ts

    ### 3. Context Propagation
    For external calls, verify:
    - HTTP: InjectHTTPContext (Go) or equivalent
    - gRPC: InjectGRPCContext (Go) or equivalent
    - Queues: PrepareQueueHeaders (Go) or equivalent

    ## Required Output Format

    ### Validation Summary
    | Check | Status | Evidence |
    |-------|--------|----------|
    | Structured Logging | ✅/❌ | [file:line or "not FOUND"] |
    | Tracing Enabled | ✅/❌ | [file:line or "not FOUND"] |
    | Instrumentation ≥90% | ✅/❌ | [X%] |
    | Context Propagation | ✅/❌/N/A | [file:line or "N/A"] |

    ### Instrumentation Coverage Table
    | Layer | Instrumented | Total | Coverage |
    |-------|--------------|-------|----------|
    | Handlers | X | Y | Z% |
    | Services | X | Y | Z% |
    | Repositories | X | Y | Z% |
    | HTTP Clients | X | Y | Z% |
    | gRPC Clients | X | Y | Z% |
    | **TOTAL** | X | Y | **Z%** |

    ### Issues Found (if any)
    For each issue:
    - **Severity:** CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
    - **Category:** [Logging|Tracing|Instrumentation|Propagation]
    - **Description:** [what's wrong]
    - **File:** [path:line]
    - **Expected:** [what should exist]
    - **Fix Required By:** [implementation_agent]

    ### Verdict
    - **all CHECKS PASSED:** ✅ YES / ❌ no
    - **Instrumentation Coverage:** [X%]
    - **If no, blocking issues:** [list]
```

## Step 4: Parse SRE Agent Output

```text
Parse agent output:

1. Extract Validation Summary table
2. Extract Instrumentation Coverage table
3. Extract Issues Found list
4. Extract Verdict

validation_state.sre_result = {
  logging_ok: [true/false],
  tracing_ok: [true/false],
  instrumentation_coverage: [percentage],
  context_propagation_ok: [true/false/na],
  issues: [list of issues],
  verdict: [PASS/FAIL]
}
```

## Step 5: Handle Validation Result

```text
if validation_state.sre_result.verdict == "PASS"
   and validation_state.sre_result.instrumentation_coverage >= 90:
  → Go to Step 8 (Success)

if validation_state.sre_result.verdict == "FAIL"
   or validation_state.sre_result.instrumentation_coverage < 90:
  → Go to Step 6 (Dispatch Fix)

if validation_state.iteration >= validation_state.max_iterations:
  → Go to Step 9 (Escalate)
```

## Step 6: Dispatch Fix to Implementation Agent

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[implementation_agent from input]"  # e.g., "ring:backend-engineer-golang"
  description: "Fix observability issues for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ FIX REQUIRED - Observability Issues Found

    ## Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Iteration:** [validation_state.iteration] of [validation_state.max_iterations]
    - **Your Previous Implementation:** [implementation_files]

    ## Issues to Fix (from SRE Validation)
    [paste issues from validation_state.sre_result.issues]

    ## Current Instrumentation Coverage
    [paste Instrumentation Coverage table from SRE output]
    **Required:** ≥90%
    **Current:** [validation_state.sre_result.instrumentation_coverage]%

    ## Standards Reference
    For Go: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang.md
    For TS: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md

    Focus on: Telemetry & Observability section

    ## Required Fixes

    ### If Logging Issues:
    - Replace fmt.Println/console.log with structured logger
    - Add trace_id to log context
    - Use JSON format

    ### If Instrumentation Coverage < 90%:
    - Add spans to all handlers: `tracer.Start(ctx, "handler.name")`
    - Add spans to all services: `tracer.Start(ctx, "service.domain.operation")`
    - Add spans to all repositories: `tracer.Start(ctx, "db.operation")`
    - Add `defer span.End()` after each span creation

    ### If Context Propagation Issues:
    - Add InjectHTTPContext for outgoing HTTP calls
    - Add InjectGRPCContext for outgoing gRPC calls
    - Add PrepareQueueHeaders for queue publishing

    ## Required Output
    - Files modified with fixes
    - New Instrumentation Coverage calculation
    - Confirmation all issues addressed
```

## Step 7: Re-Validate After Fix

```text
validation_state.iteration += 1

if validation_state.iteration > validation_state.max_iterations:
  → Go to Step 9 (Escalate)

→ Go back to Step 3 (Dispatch SRE Agent)
```

## Step 8: Success - Prepare Output

```text
Generate skill output:

## Validation Result
**Status:** PASS
**Iterations:** [validation_state.iteration]
**Instrumentation Coverage:** [validation_state.sre_result.instrumentation_coverage]%

## Instrumentation Coverage
[paste final Instrumentation Coverage table]

## Issues Found
None (all resolved)

## Handoff to Next Gate
- SRE validation: COMPLETE
- Logging: ✅ Structured JSON with trace_id
- Tracing: ✅ OpenTelemetry instrumented
- Instrumentation: ✅ [X]% coverage
- Ready for Gate 3 (Testing): YES
```

## Step 9: Escalate - Max Iterations Reached

```text
Generate skill output:

## Validation Result
**Status:** FAIL
**Iterations:** [validation_state.iteration] (MAX REACHED)
**Instrumentation Coverage:** [validation_state.sre_result.instrumentation_coverage]%

## Instrumentation Coverage
[paste final Instrumentation Coverage table]

## Issues Found
[list remaining unresolved issues]

## Handoff to Next Gate
- SRE validation: FAILED
- Remaining issues: [count]
- Ready for Gate 3 (Testing): no
- **Action Required:** User must manually resolve remaining issues

⛔ ESCALATION: Max iterations (3) reached. User intervention required.
```

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Scenario | Gate 2 Status | Action |
|----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Missing all observability (no structured logs) | FAIL | ❌ Return to Gate 0 |
| **CRITICAL** | fmt.Println/echo instead of JSON logs | FAIL | ❌ Return to Gate 0 |
| **CRITICAL** | Instrumentation coverage < 50% | FAIL | ❌ Return to Gate 0 |
| **CRITICAL** | "DEFERRED" appears in validation output | FAIL | ❌ Return to Gate 0 |
| **HIGH** | Instrumentation coverage 50-89% | NEEDS_FIXES | ⚠️ Fix and re-validate |
| **MEDIUM** | Missing context propagation | NEEDS_FIXES | ⚠️ Fix and re-validate |
| **LOW** | Minor logging improvements | PASS | ✅ Note for future |

---

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

<block_condition>
If any condition is true, STOP and dispatch fix or escalate to user.
- Service lacks JSON-structured logs
- Instrumentation coverage < 50%
- Max iterations (3) reached
</block_condition>

| Decision Type | Examples | Action |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| **HARD BLOCK** | Service lacks JSON structured logs | **STOP** - Dispatch fix to implementation agent |
| **HARD BLOCK** | Instrumentation coverage < 50% | **STOP** - Dispatch fix to implementation agent |
| **HARD BLOCK** | Max iterations reached | **STOP** - Escalate to user |

---

### Cannot Be Overridden

<cannot_skip>
- Gate 2 execution (no MVP exemptions)
- 90% instrumentation coverage minimum
- JSON structured logs requirement
</cannot_skip>

| Requirement | Cannot Be Waived By | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Gate 2 execution | CTO, PM, "MVP" arguments | Observability prevents production blindness |
| 90% instrumentation coverage | "We'll add spans later" | Later = never. Instrument during implementation. |
| JSON structured logs | "Plain text is enough" | Plain text is unsearchable in production |

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Skip SRE validation" | "Observability is MANDATORY. Dispatching SRE agent now." |
| "90% coverage is too high" | "90% is the Ring Standard minimum. Cannot lower." |
| "Will add instrumentation later" | "Instrumentation is part of implementation. Fix now." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate 2-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "OpenTelemetry library is installed" | Installation ≠ Instrumentation | **Verify spans exist in code** |
| "Middleware handles tracing" | Middleware = root span only | **Add child spans in all layers** |
| "Small function doesn't need span" | Size is irrelevant | **Add span to every function** |
| "Only external calls need tracing" | Internal ops need tracing too | **Instrument all layers** |
| "Feature complete, observability later" | Observability IS completion | **Fix NOW before Gate 3** |

## Component Type Requirements

| Type | JSON Logs | Tracing | Instrumentation |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **API Service** | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | 90%+ |
| **Background Worker** | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | 90%+ |
| **CLI Tool** | REQUIRED | N/A | N/A |
| **Library** | N/A | N/A | N/A |
