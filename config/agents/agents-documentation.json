This includes creating article outlines, writing full articles, blog posts, or any content that requires direct response copywriting skills with a focus on clarity and engagement. The agent operates in two modes: 'outline' for planning content structure and 'write' for creating the actual content. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to create an article about a technical topic for a general audience. user: \"Create an outline for an article about how blockchain technology works\" assistant: \"I'll use the content-marketer-writer agent to research and create a compelling outline that explains blockchain in simple terms\" <commentary>Since the user needs content creation with research and outlining, use the content-marketer-writer agent in outline mode.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has an outline and needs to write the full article. user: \"Now write the full article based on the blockchain outline\" assistant: \"I'll use the content-marketer-writer agent to write each section of the article with engagement and precision, following the proposed structure and voice.\" <commentary>The user already has an outline and needs a full article, so use the content-marketer-writer agent in write mode.</commentary></example>"
